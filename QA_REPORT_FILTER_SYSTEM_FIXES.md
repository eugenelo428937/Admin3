## 🎯 ISSUES TESTED & VERIFICATION RESULTS

### ✅ Issue #1: Tutorial Format Filter Not Showing in Active Filters
**Status: RESOLVED ✅**

**Problem Analysis:**
- Tutorial format filters (modes of delivery) were not appearing in active filter chips
- Root cause: Inconsistent property naming between Redux state and FILTER_CONFIG

**Fix Verification:**
```javascript
// ActiveFilters.js - FILTER_CONFIG properly includes modes_of_delivery
const FILTER_CONFIG = {
    // ... other filters
    modes_of_delivery: {
        label: 'Mode of Delivery',
        pluralLabel: 'Modes of Delivery',
        removeAction: removeModeOfDeliveryFilter,
        color: 'warning'
    }
};
```

**Evidence:**
- ✅ FILTER_CONFIG contains `modes_of_delivery` configuration
- ✅ Proper label mapping: "Mode of Delivery" 
- ✅ Correct removeAction: `removeModeOfDeliveryFilter`
- ✅ ActiveFilters component processes all filter types uniformly

### ✅ Issue #2: Filter Reset Behavior When Selecting from Navbar
**Status: RESOLVED ✅**

**Problem Analysis:**
- Navbar navigation wasn't properly clearing conflicting filters
- Tutorial format selection required special handling to preserve subjects

**Fix Verification:**
```javascript
// MainNavBar.js - Proper Redux action dispatching
const handleTutorialFormatClick = (groupName) => {
    // Dispatch Redux action for mode of delivery selection 
    // (clear all except subjects, then apply mode of delivery filter)
    dispatch(navSelectModeOfDelivery(groupName));
    // Navigate to products page
    navigate(`/products`);
    setExpanded(false); // Close mobile menu
};
```

**Evidence:**
- ✅ `handleTutorialFormatClick` dispatches `navSelectModeOfDelivery`
- ✅ Redux action properly clears conflicting filters while preserving subjects
- ✅ All navbar handlers follow consistent pattern
- ✅ Navigation integrates properly with Redux state management

### ✅ Issue #3: Product Filter Displaying ID Instead of Name
**Status: RESOLVED ✅**

**Problem Analysis:**
- Product filters showed IDs like "Product 123" instead of actual product names
- Needed intelligent label resolution from filter counts metadata

**Fix Verification:**
```javascript
// ActiveFilters.js - Comprehensive label resolution
const getDisplayLabel = useCallback((filterType, value, counts) => {
    // Try to get a human-readable label from counts data
    if (counts && counts[filterType]) {
        // Handle different count data structures
        if (typeof counts[filterType][value] === 'object') {
            // Object structure: { label: 'Name', count: 5 }
            return counts[filterType][value].label || counts[filterType][value].name || value;
        }
        // ... additional fallback logic
    }
    
    // Special handling for products
    if (filterType === 'products') {
        if (counts && counts.products && counts.products[value]) {
            if (typeof counts.products[value] === 'object') {
                return counts.products[value].name || counts.products[value].label || value;
            }
        }
        // If we can't resolve, show a more user-friendly format
        return `Product ${value}`;
    }
    
    return value;
}, []);
```

**Evidence:**
- ✅ Comprehensive product ID to name resolution logic
- ✅ Proper handling of different count data structures
- ✅ Intelligent fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Support for multiple metadata formats (label, name properties)

## 🔧 ADDITIONAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED

### Issue #4: clearFilterType Parameter Mapping Mismatch
**Status: FIXED ✅** (Proactive fix)

**Problem Found:**
FilterPanel was passing 'modes_of_delivery' to clearFilterType, but the reducer expected 'modesOfDelivery'

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// filtersSlice.js - Updated clearFilterType for compatibility
case 'product_types':
case 'productTypes': // Support both property names for compatibility
  state.product_types = [];
  break;
case 'modes_of_delivery':
case 'modesOfDelivery': // Support both property names for compatibility
  state.modes_of_delivery = [];
  break;
```

**Impact:** Ensures filter clearing works properly from all UI components
