"""
Test script to validate the acknowledgment validation fix

This script tests that acknowledgments from multiple entry points
(checkout_terms, checkout_payment) are properly validated and not
incorrectly marked as "stale" during order creation.

The bug was that _get_matched_rules_for_current_execution only checked
checkout_terms entry point, so tutorial credit card acknowledgments
from checkout_payment were always marked as stale.
