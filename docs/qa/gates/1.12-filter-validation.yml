recommendations:
  immediate:  # Must complete before marking story Done
    - action: 'Complete Phase 3.3: Redux Integration (T009-T011)'
      refs: ['filtersSlice.js']
      rationale: 'AC4 requires validationErrors state and actions in Redux'

    - action: 'Complete Phase 3.4: UI Integration (T012-T013)'
      refs: ['FilterPanel.js']
      rationale: 'AC5 requires validation error display in FilterPanel'

    - action: 'Complete Phase 3.5: API Prevention (T014-T015)'
      refs: ['useProductsSearch.js']
      rationale: 'AC6 requires API call prevention when validation errors exist'

    - action: 'Complete Phase 3.6: Integration Testing (T016-T017)'
      refs: ['integration tests']
      rationale: 'Verify end-to-end validation workflow with user interactions'

    - action: 'Update Definition of Done checkboxes to match actual completion'
      refs: ['story-1.12-filter-validation.md']
      rationale: 'DoD section currently misleading - shows all items checked when many are incomplete'

  future:  # Nice-to-have improvements
    - action: 'Add test case for null filters parameter'
      refs: ['filterValidator.test.js']
      rationale: 'Achieve 100% coverage by testing line 16 null check (currently 92.59%)'

    - action: 'Consider extracting error messages to i18n file'
      refs: ['filterValidator.js']
      rationale: 'AC13 mentions localization-ready messages as future enhancement'
