- Staff managing course enrollments, student records, and tutorial scheduling
- Need efficient workflows for processing bulk administrative tasks
- Require comprehensive reporting and data management capabilities

**Students**
- Users browsing courses, tutorials, and managing their educational journey
- Need clear course discovery and enrollment processes
- Require mobile-friendly access for on-the-go learning management

**Instructors/Tutors**
- Professionals managing course content and student interactions
- Need streamlined course administration and student communication tools

## 2. Information Architecture

### Site Structure & Navigation Hierarchy

**Primary Navigation (7 Main Sections):**
1. **Dashboard** - Role-based overview and quick actions
2. **Courses** - Course catalog, subject browsing, enrollment management
3. **Tutorials** - Tutorial scheduling, instructor selection, event management
4. **Cart** - Shopping cart, order management, checkout process
5. **Profile** - User account, preferences, order history
6. **Admin** - Administrative tools (role-restricted)
7. **Support** - Help resources, contact information

**Mobile Navigation Pattern:**
- Hamburger menu with slide-out drawer
- Collapsible accordion submenus
- Touch-optimized navigation with 56px minimum touch targets

### Content Organization Strategy

**Business Domain Separation:**
- **Academic Content**: Courses, subjects, tutorials, examinations
- **Administrative Content**: User management, enrollment processing, reporting
- **Commerce Content**: Product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing

**Task-Oriented Layout Principles:**
- Primary actions prominently displayed
- Secondary actions accessible but not competing for attention
- Context-sensitive navigation based on user role and current task

### User Flow Patterns

**1. Course Discovery & Enrollment**
```
Browse Subjects → Filter/Search → Course Details → Add to Cart → Checkout → Confirmation
```

**2. Tutorial Booking**
```
Search Tutorials → Select Date/Time → Choose Instructor → Review Selection → Confirm Booking
```

**3. Administrative Management**
```
Dashboard → Student Records → Bulk Actions → Approve/Process → Generate Reports
```

**4. Profile & Account Management**
```
Login → Profile Update → Preferences → Order History → Account Settings
```

### Data Entity Relationships

**Frontend Data Model Mapping:**
- **Products** ↔ **ProductVariations** ↔ **ExamSessions** (Course catalog structure)
- **Cart/CartItems** ↔ **Orders/OrderItems** (Commerce workflow)
- **Users** ↔ **UserProfiles** ↔ **Permissions** (Role-based access)
- **Tutorials** ↔ **Sessions** ↔ **Instructors** (Tutorial management)

## 3. Technical Requirements & Constraints

### React Architecture Patterns

**Component Strategy:**
- **Functional Components**: Modern React with hooks for all new development
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable stateful logic (useAuth, useCart, useProducts)
- **Context API**: Global state management for authentication, cart, and user preferences

**State Management Approach:**
- **Local State**: Component-specific data using useState/useReducer
- **Context API**: Shared state across component trees (Auth, Cart, Products)
- **Server State**: React Query for API data fetching and caching

### Material-UI Integration

**Primary Component Categories:**
- **Layout**: Container, Grid, Box, Stack for responsive layouts
- **Navigation**: AppBar, Drawer, Tabs, Breadcrumbs for navigation
- **Inputs**: TextField, Select, Checkbox, Button for forms
- **Data Display**: Table, List, Card, Typography for content presentation
- **Feedback**: Alert, Snackbar, Progress, Skeleton for user feedback

**Styling Strategy:**
- **Theme System**: Material-UI theme with custom color palette and typography
- **Responsive Design**: Theme breakpoints (xs: 0px, sm: 600px, md: 900px, lg: 1200px, xl: 1536px)
- **Component Styling**: sx prop for component-specific styles, styled components for complex customization

### Performance Requirements

**Key Performance Metrics:**
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: < 2.5 seconds
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 4.0 seconds  
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: < 5.0 seconds
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based and component-based lazy loading
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree shaking, chunk optimization, dynamic imports
- **Image Optimization**: WebP format, responsive images, lazy loading
- **Caching Strategy**: Service worker caching, API response caching

### Browser Compatibility

**Supported Browsers:**
- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Mobile Support**: iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile 90+, Samsung Internet 14+

**Technical Constraints:**
- **Single UI Library**: Material-UI only (remove Bootstrap dependency)
- **API Integration**: REST API with Django backend, JWT authentication
- **Security Requirements**: CORS compliance, CSP headers, secure authentication

## 4. Implementation Planning

### Component Architecture Strategy

**Modular Navigation System:**
Replace the monolithic 1170-line ActEdNavbar.js with a modular architecture:

```
src/components/navigation/
├── ResponsiveNavbar.jsx       # Main navbar coordinator
├── MobileNavbar.jsx           # Mobile-first implementation
├── DesktopNavbar.jsx          # Desktop enhancement
├── NavigationDrawer.jsx       # Mobile slide-out menu
├── UserMenu.jsx               # Account/auth menu
├── SearchMenu.jsx             # Search functionality
├── CartMenu.jsx               # Shopping cart
└── submenus/
    ├── SubjectsMenu.jsx       # Subjects navigation
    ├── ProductsMenu.jsx       # Products navigation
    ├── TutorialsMenu.jsx      # Tutorials navigation
    └── DistanceLearningMenu.jsx
```

### Navigation Refactoring Strategy

**Mobile-First Navigation Pattern:**

1. **Top App Bar**: Sticky header with hamburger menu, logo, and action icons
2. **Navigation Drawer**: 85vw width, touch-optimized with accordion submenus
