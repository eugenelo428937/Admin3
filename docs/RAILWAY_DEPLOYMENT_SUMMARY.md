## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option A: Fully Automated (Recommended for first-time deploy)

**Time:** ~10-15 minutes (hands-off)

```powershell
.\scripts\deploy-to-railway.ps1 -Full
```

This will:
- ✅ Initialize Railway project
- ✅ Create PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Deploy Django backend
- ✅ Deploy React frontend
- ✅ Configure all environment variables
- ✅ Set up CORS
- ✅ Run database migrations
- ✅ Generate public domains

**Best for:** First-time deployment, quick setup

---

### Option B: Manual Step-by-Step (Recommended for learning/customization)

**Time:** ~20-30 minutes (guided)

Follow the instructions in `docs/RAILWAY_QUICKSTART.md`

**Best for:** Understanding each step, custom configuration needs

---

## 🎯 Quick Decision Matrix

**Choose Automated if:**
- ⚡ You want the fastest deployment
- 🔄 This is your first time deploying to Railway
- 📝 You trust the default configuration
- 🚀 You want to get it running ASAP

**Choose Manual if:**
- 🎓 You want to learn the Railway platform
- ⚙️ You need custom environment variables

## 📋 Git Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure
```
main (production-ready, protected)
  │
  ├── develop (integration, protected)
  │     │
  │     ├── feature/* (development)
  │     └── bugfix/* (fixes)
  │
  └── uat (UAT/demo, auto-deploy to Railway)
```

### Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create UAT branch (one-time)
git checkout -b uat
git push -u origin uat

# 2. Configure Railway to watch 'uat' branch (via Dashboard)

# 3. Deploy to UAT by pushing
git checkout uat
git merge develop
git push origin uat  # Auto-deploys to Railway
```

---
