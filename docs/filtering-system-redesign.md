# Product Filtering System Redesign

## Project Overview

Complete architectural redesign of the product filtering system for the Admin3 online store. The current system suffers from fundamental architectural issues that make it unmaintainable, performance problems, and poor user experience.

## Executive Summary

### Current Problems
- **Multiple Sources of Truth**: URL params, panel filters, and search filters all managed separately
- **1000+ Line Components**: ProductList.js has become unmaintainable with complex state management
- **Parameter Name Mismatches**: Frontend sends `subject`, backend expects `SUBJECT_FILTER`
- **Dual Database Systems**: Both `acted_filter_group` and `acted_product_group` exist, causing confusion
- **Filter Service Not Used**: Existing filter service is bypassed by manual filtering logic
- **Infinite Re-renders**: Multiple useEffect loops causing performance issues
- **No State Persistence**: Filters don't survive page reloads

### Proposed Solution
Implement a modern Redux Toolkit + RTK Query architecture with cookie-based persistence, unified API endpoints, and optimized database queries.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
```
Redux Store (Single Source of Truth)
├── Filters Slice (subjects, categories, products, etc.)
├── RTK Query API Layer (catalogApi)
└── Cookie Persistence Middleware

Components (Simplified)
├── ProductList (~150 lines, down from 1000+)
├── FilterPanel (checkbox interface)
├── ActiveFilters (removable pills)
└── ProductGrid (display layer)
```

### Backend Architecture
```
Single API Endpoint: POST /api/products/search/
├── Request: { filters: {...}, pagination: {...} }
├── Response: { products: [...], filter_counts: {...} }
└── Unified filtering from acted_exam_session_subject_products table
```

### State Management Flow
```
User Interaction → Redux Action → Cookie Update → Debounced API Call → UI Update
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Redux Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Backend Tasks:**
- Create unified `POST /api/products/search/` endpoint
- Implement disjunctive facet counting (Amazon-style)
- Add proper database indexes for performance

**Frontend Tasks:**
- Set up Redux Toolkit + RTK Query
- Implement filters slice with navigation behaviors
- Add cookie persistence middleware
- Create debounced search hook

**Success Criteria:**
- Single API endpoint working with proper filter counts
- Redux store managing all filter state
- Cookie persistence working across page reloads

### Phase 2: Component Integration (Week 2-3)
**Tasks:**
- Refactor ProductList.js from 1000+ to ~150 lines
- Create simplified FilterPanel component
- Implement ActiveFilters with removable pills
- Add navigation menu integration with special behaviors

**Success Criteria:**

- Navigation behaviors working as specified

### Phase 3: Database Optimization (Week 3-4)
**Tasks:**
- Add critical database indexes
- Optimize filter queries using JOINs
- Implement filter analytics tracking
- Performance testing and optimization

**Success Criteria:**
- Filter response times < 200ms for typical queries
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Filter usage analytics working

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4-5)
**Tasks:**
- Implement intelligent caching strategy
- Add filter suggestions based on usage patterns
- Real-time filter analytics
- Performance monitoring and alerting

**Success Criteria:**
- Caching reduces API calls by 60%
- Smart filter suggestions working
- Performance monitoring dashboard active

## Database Schema Changes

### Required Indexes
```sql
-- Critical indexes for filter performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_essp_active_subject ON acted_exam_sessions_subjects_products 
(is_active, exam_session_subject_id) WHERE is_active = true;

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_essp_subject_product ON acted_exam_sessions_subjects_products 
(exam_session_subject_id, product_id);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_product_groups_lookup ON acted_product_productgroup 
(product_id, product_group_id);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_subjects_code ON acted_subjects (code);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_product_variations_delivery ON acted_product_variations 
(product_id, mode_of_delivery);
```

### New Analytics Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE acted_filter_analytics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    filter_combination JSONB NOT NULL,
    usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    last_used TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    avg_results_count FLOAT,
    avg_response_time FLOAT
);

CREATE INDEX idx_filter_analytics_usage ON acted_filter_analytics 
USING GIN (filter_combination);
```

## API Specification

### Unified Search Endpoint

**Request:**
```http
POST /api/products/search/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "filters": {
    "subjects": ["CM2", "SA1"],
    "categories": ["Bundle"],
    "product_types": ["Core Study Material"],
    "products": ["Additional Mock Pack"],
    "modes_of_delivery": ["Ebook"]
  },
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "page_size": 20
  },
  "options": {
    "include_bundles": true,
    "include_analytics": false
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "name": "Core Reading",
      "subjectCodes": ["CM2"],
      "category": "Materials",
      "productType": "Core Study Material",
      "modeOfDelivery": ["Ebook", "Printed"],
      "price": 89.99
    }
  ],
  "filter_counts": {
    "subjects": {"CM2": 45, "SA1": 23},
    "categories": {"Bundle": 12, "Materials": 67},
    "product_types": {"Core Study Material": 34},
    "products": {"Core Reading": 15},
    "modes_of_delivery": {"Ebook": 89, "Printed": 67}
  },
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "page_size": 20,
    "total_count": 156,
    "has_next": true,
    "has_previous": false
  }
}
```

## Navigation Menu Integration

### Special Behaviors Required

1. **Subject Selection**: Clear existing subject filters, then set new subject
2. **"View All Products"**: Clear all filters except subjects
3. **Product Group Selection**: Clear all except subjects, then filter by Product Type
4. **Product Selection**: Clear all except subjects, then filter by Product

### Implementation
```javascript
// Navigation actions in Redux slice
navSelectSubject(state, action) {
  state.subjects = [action.payload]; // Replace, don't append
},
navViewAllProducts(state) {
  // Clear all except subjects
  state.products = [];
  state.categories = [];
  state.product_types = [];
  state.modes_of_delivery = [];
},
navSelectProductGroup(state, action) {
  // Clear all except subjects, then filter by Product Type
  state.products = [];
  state.categories = [];
  state.product_types = [action.payload];
  state.modes_of_delivery = [];
}
```

## Performance Targets

### Response Times
- Filter API calls: < 200ms average
- Page load with cached filters: < 1s
- Filter panel updates: < 100ms

### User Experience
- Filter state persists across page reloads
- No infinite loading states
- Immediate visual feedback on filter changes
- Accurate filter counts at all times

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Redux actions and reducers
- API endpoint filtering logic
- Database query performance

### Integration Tests
- Full filter flow from UI to database
- Navigation menu behaviors
- Cookie persistence

### Performance Tests
- Database query optimization
- Large dataset filtering
- Concurrent user filtering

## Risk Mitigation

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Feature Flag**: Deploy behind feature flag for gradual rollout
2. **A/B Testing**: Compare new vs old system performance
3. **Rollback Plan**: Maintain old system as fallback
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time performance and error monitoring

### Data Migration
1. **Dual System**: Run both systems in parallel initially
2. **Gradual Migration**: Migrate filter configurations incrementally
3. **Validation**: Compare results between old and new systems
4. **Cleanup**: Remove old system only after validation
