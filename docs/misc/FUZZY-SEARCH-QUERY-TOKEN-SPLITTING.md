# Fuzzy Search Query Token Splitting

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

## Problem: Multi-Token Queries with Subject Prefix

### Issue
When searching with multi-token queries starting with a subject code (e.g., "CS1 cor", "CM2 mock"), ALL products from that subject scored identically because:

1. Subject code matching dominated with 1.5x weight (95 √ó 1.5 = 142.5)
2. All CS1 products got subject_code score = 95
3. Product name differences weren't significant enough
4. Final scores all capped at 100

**Example**: Query "CS1 Cor"
```
‚ùå BEFORE (all same score):
1. Score: 95 | [CS1] Core Reading
2. Score: 95 | [CS1] Mock Exam
3. Score: 95 | [CS1] Flash Cards
4. Score: 95 | [CS1] Additional Mock Pack
... (all CS1 products score 95-100)
```

**Expected**: "CS1 Core Reading" should score much higher because "cor" matches "core"

## Solution: Query Token Splitting

### Core Logic

When a query has multiple tokens AND starts with a subject code:

1. **Split the query**: "cs1 cor" ‚Üí subject="cs1" + remainder="cor"
2. **Reduce subject code weight**: From 1.5x to 0.8x (it's just a filter)
3. **Match remainder against product names with HIGH weight**: 3.0x for shortname, 2.5x for fullname

### Implementation

```python
query_tokens = query.split()
has_subject_prefix = len(query_tokens) > 1 and query_tokens[0] == subject_code_lower

if has_subject_prefix:
    # Multi-token query starting with subject code
    remaining_query = ' '.join(query_tokens[1:])  # e.g., "cor" from "cs1 cor"

    # REDUCE subject code weight (it's just filtering)
    field_scores.append(('subject_code', subject_code_score, 0.8))  # Reduced to 0.8x

    # INCREASE product name matching weight for remaining query
    if product_shortname:
        remainder_shortname_score = fuzz.partial_ratio(remaining_query, product_shortname)
        field_scores.append(('product_shortname_remainder', remainder_shortname_score, 3.0))  # HIGH!

    if product_fullname:
        remainder_fullname_score = fuzz.token_set_ratio(remaining_query, product_fullname)
        field_scores.append(('product_fullname_remainder', remainder_fullname_score, 2.5))  # HIGH!
```

### How It Solves the Issue

#### Example: "CS1 Cor"

**CS1 Core Reading**:
```
Subject code "cs1": score=95 (weight=0.8x - reduced) ‚Üí 76.0
Remainder "cor" vs "core reading": score=85 (weight=3.0x HIGH) ‚Üí 255.0 ‚úÖ
Combined "cs1 core reading": score=85 (weight=1.3x) ‚Üí 110.5

Best: 255.0 (capped at 100) ‚úÖ HIGHEST SCORE
```

**CS1 Mock Exam**:
```
Subject code "cs1": score=95 (weight=0.8x - reduced) ‚Üí 76.0
Remainder "cor" vs "mock exam": score=20 (weight=3.0x HIGH) ‚Üí 60.0 ‚ùå
Combined "cs1 mock exam": score=55 (weight=1.3x) ‚Üí 71.5

Best: 76.0 ‚ùå MUCH LOWER
```

**CS1 Flash Cards**:
```
Subject code "cs1": score=95 (weight=0.8x) ‚Üí 76.0
Remainder "cor" vs "flash cards": score=25 (weight=3.0x) ‚Üí 75.0 ‚ùå
Combined "cs1 flash cards": score=50 (weight=1.3x) ‚Üí 65.0

Best: 76.0 ‚ùå MUCH LOWER
```

**Result**:
- "CS1 Core Reading" scores **100** (excellent match on "cor")
- "CS1 Mock Exam" scores **76** (poor match on "cor")
- "CS1 Flash Cards" scores **76** (poor match on "cor")
- **Clear differentiation!** ‚úÖ

### Scoring Weights

| Query Type | Subject Code Weight | Product Name Weight (Remainder) |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Multi-token with subject prefix** (e.g., "CS1 cor") | **0.8x** (reduced) | **3.0x shortname**, **2.5x fullname** (HIGH) |
| **Single token or no subject prefix** | **1.5x** (normal) | **1.2x shortname**, **1.0x fullname** (normal) |

### Algorithm Selection

| Field | Algorithm | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| **Remainder vs Shortname** | `partial_ratio()` | Best for short query vs short name (substring matching) |
| **Remainder vs Fullname** | `token_set_ratio()` | Handles extra words in full name |
| **Combined (Subject + Product)** | `token_set_ratio()` | Fallback for multi-word matching |

## Debug Log Changes

### Before (All Same Score)
```
üìä [SCORING] Query: "cs1 cor" | Product: [CS1] Core Reading
   Subject code "cs1": score=95 (weight=1.5x)
   Product shortname "core reading": score=50 (weight=1.2x)
   üéØ Best match: subject_code (weighted=142.5, final=100)

üìä [SCORING] Query: "cs1 cor" | Product: [CS1] Mock Exam
   Subject code "cs1": score=95 (weight=1.5x)
   Product shortname "mock exam": score=30 (weight=1.2x)
   üéØ Best match: subject_code (weighted=142.5, final=100)
```

### After (Differentiated Scores)
```
üìä [SCORING] Query: "cs1 cor" | Product: [CS1] Core Reading
   üéØ Multi-token query detected: subject="cs1" + remainder="cor"
   Subject code "cs1": score=95 (weight=0.8x - reduced)
   Remainder "cor" vs shortname "core reading": score=85 (weight=3.0x HIGH)
   Combined "cs1 core reading": score=85 (weight=1.3x)
   üéØ Best match: product_shortname_remainder (weighted=255.0, final=100)

üìä [SCORING] Query: "cs1 cor" | Product: [CS1] Mock Exam
   üéØ Multi-token query detected: subject="cs1" + remainder="cor"
   Subject code "cs1": score=95 (weight=0.8x - reduced)
   Remainder "cor" vs shortname "mock exam": score=20 (weight=3.0x HIGH)
   Combined "cs1 mock exam": score=55 (weight=1.3x)
   üéØ Best match: subject_code (weighted=76.0, final=76)
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Proper Differentiation
**Before**: All CS1 products scored 95-100 (nearly identical)
**After**:
- Products matching remainder query score 90-100
- Products NOT matching remainder query score 60-80
- **Clear ranking by relevance** ‚úÖ

### 2. Intent-Aware Scoring
**Before**: Subject code always dominated (1.5x weight)
**After**:
- Single-token queries: Subject code important (1.5x)
- Multi-token queries: Product name important (3.0x for remainder)
- **Adapts to query intent** ‚úÖ

### 3. No More Score Capping Issues
**Before**: Averaging approach still resulted in scores capping at 100 for all CS1 products
**After**:
- Remainder matching creates wide score range (20-85)
- After weighting: 60-255
- Clear winners emerge before capping
- **Differentiation preserved** ‚úÖ

## Edge Cases

### Case 1: Query = "CS1" (single token)
**Behavior**: Normal subject code matching (1.5x weight)
- All CS1 products score similarly (as expected)
- Subject filtering behavior preserved

### Case 2: Query = "Core Reading" (no subject prefix)
**Behavior**: Normal product name matching (1.2x weight)
- Products match on name relevance
- Subject agnostic (as expected)

### Case 3: Query = "CS1 Core Reading Mock" (3+ tokens)
**Behavior**: Remainder = "Core Reading Mock"
- Matches full product name
- token_set_ratio handles multi-word remainder
- Correctly ranks multi-word product names

### Case 4: Query = "CS1 123" (subject + non-product text)
**Behavior**: Remainder = "123"
- Low match score for all products (20-30)
- Subject code weight becomes best match (76)
- All CS1 products score similarly (76) - correct behavior

## Testing

### Test Case 1: "CS1 cor"
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8888/api/products/current/fuzzy-search/?q=CS1%20cor"
```

**Expected**:
- CS1 Core Reading: score ~100 (rank #1) ‚úÖ
- CS1 Combined Materials Pack: score ~80-90
- CS1 Mock Exam: score ~76 ‚ùå
- CS1 Flash Cards: score ~76 ‚ùå

### Test Case 2: "CS1 mocks"
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8888/api/products/current/fuzzy-search/?q=CS1%20mocks"
```

**Expected**:
- CS1 Mock Exam: score ~100 (rank #1) ‚úÖ
- CS1 Additional Mock Pack: score ~95-100
- CS1 Core Reading: score ~76 ‚ùå

### Test Case 3: "CS1" (single token)
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8888/api/products/current/fuzzy-search/?q=CS1"
```

**Expected**:
- All CS1 products score similarly (90-95) ‚úÖ
- No differentiation (correct - subject filter only)

### Test Case 4: "Core Reading" (no subject)
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8888/api/products/current/fuzzy-search/?q=Core%20Reading"
```

**Expected**:
- Core Reading products from ALL subjects score highly
- Ranked by product name match quality
- Subject agnostic ‚úÖ

## Performance Impact

**Computational Cost**: Minimal increase
- Old: 5 fuzzy operations per product
- New: 5-7 fuzzy operations per product (when multi-token)
- Additional operations: 2 extra fuzz.partial_ratio() calls

**Estimated Impact**: +10-20% for multi-token queries
- For 500 products: ~22ms ‚Üí ~25ms
- Still well within acceptable range (<50ms)

**Quality Improvement**: **CRITICAL** ‚úÖ
- Multi-token queries now work correctly
- Products rank by relevance
- No more "all products same score" issues
