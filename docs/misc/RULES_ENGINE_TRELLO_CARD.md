# Rules Engine Revision - Trello Card Content

## Card Title
🔧 **Rules Engine Architecture Revision - Fix Consistency Issues**

## Card Description

### Overview
Comprehensive revision of Admin3's Rules Engine to address consistency issues and implement robust, scalable business rule management system with enterprise-grade features.

### Problem Statement
- Current rules engine has consistency issues across entry points
- Limited auditing and debugging capabilities
- Performance bottlenecks with rule evaluation
- Security concerns with custom logic execution
- Maintenance challenges with rule modifications

### Solution Architecture
Rebuild rules engine with:
- **Declarative JSON-based rule definitions** (no code changes for rule updates)
- **Server-side authority** for critical flows (checkout, payments)
- **Comprehensive audit trail** with full context snapshots
- **Sandboxed custom functions** with WASM/JS execution limits
- **Multi-level caching** (memory + Redis) for performance
- **Real-time monitoring** with metrics and alerting

---

## Technical Specifications

### Core Components
1. **RuleEngine** - Main orchestrator (`execute(entryPoint, context)`)
2. **RuleRepository** - CRUD + versioning (PostgreSQL JSONB with caching)
3. **Validator** - JSON Schema validation for context
4. **ConditionEvaluator** - JSONLogic expressions with pre-compilation
5. **ActionDispatcher** - Command pattern for pluggable action handlers
6. **MessageTemplateService** - Multi-format rendering (HTML/JSON/Markdown)
7. **ExecutionStore** - Audit trail with context snapshots
8. **FunctionRegistry** - Sandboxed custom functions (WASM/serverless)

### Action Types
- `display_message` - Non-blocking informational messages
- `display_modal` - Modal dialogs requiring user interaction
- `user_acknowledge` - Terms & conditions acceptance tracking
- `user_preference` - Optional user preference collection
- `update` - Safe field updates with allow-lists and transactions

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Rules stored in JSONB with versioning
CREATE TABLE rules_engine_rule (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    entry_point VARCHAR(100),
    priority INTEGER,
    active BOOLEAN,
    version INTEGER,
    condition JSONB,
    actions JSONB,
    metadata JSONB
);

-- Execution audit trail
CREATE TABLE rules_engine_execution (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    rule_id VARCHAR(255),
    entry_point VARCHAR(100),
    context_snapshot JSONB,
    actions_result JSONB,
    outcome VARCHAR(50),
    execution_time_ms INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_rules_entry_active_priority ON rules_engine_rule (entry_point, active, priority);
CREATE INDEX idx_rules_jsonb_condition ON rules_engine_rule USING GIN (condition);
```
