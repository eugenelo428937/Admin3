# User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

The new UI elements will integrate with the existing Material-UI component library and React component patterns. Based on the existing system architecture using React 18 with Material-UI, the enhancements will:

- **Rules Engine UI**: Extend existing admin dashboard components for rule configuration and management
- **Mobile Layout**: Utilize Material-UI's responsive grid system and breakpoints while maintaining existing component hierarchy
- **Registration Form**: Build upon existing authentication components, adding progressive disclosure patterns for employer information
- **Delivery Details**: Integrate with existing user profile and checkout components using consistent form patterns
- **Recommended Products**: Follow existing product card design patterns with enhanced recommendation indicators

### Modified/New Screens and Views

**Modified Screens**:
- User Registration Form - Enhanced with employer auto-completion and progressive fields
- Checkout Process - Added employer warning messages and contact details display
- User Profile Management - New delivery and contact details sections
- Product Listing Pages - Added recommended products sections
- Mobile Navigation - Optimized for touch interactions across all existing screens

**New Screens**:
- Rules Engine Configuration Dashboard (Admin)
- VAT Configuration Interface (Admin)
- Employer Contact Management (Admin)
- Mobile-optimized versions of existing forms and interfaces

### UI Consistency Requirements

**UCR1**: All new UI components must follow existing Material-UI theme including colors, typography, and spacing standards

**UCR2**: Mobile enhancements must maintain visual consistency with desktop versions while optimizing for touch interactions

**UCR3**: Form validation patterns must be consistent across registration, profile management, and checkout processes

**UCR4**: Loading states and error handling must follow existing patterns established in the current React component library

**UCR5**: Admin interfaces for rules engine configuration must integrate seamlessly with existing admin dashboard navigation and styling
