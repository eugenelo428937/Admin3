# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Python 3.x, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
**Frameworks**: Django 5.1, Django REST Framework, React 18, Material-UI
**Database**: PostgreSQL (ACTEDDBDEV01)
**Infrastructure**: Windows development environment, existing deployment pipeline
**External Dependencies**: Administrate API (GraphQL), MJML for email templates

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Extend existing schema with new tables for rules engine entry points, VAT configuration, and employer information while maintaining foreign key relationships with current user and product models

**API Integration Strategy**: Add new REST endpoints for rules engine management, VAT calculations, and employer services while preserving existing API structure and authentication patterns

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Enhance existing React components with responsive design improvements and new features while maintaining current routing and state management patterns

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Extend existing Django APITestCase patterns for backend rule engine testing and add React component tests for mobile responsiveness and new UI features

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Follow existing Django app structure with new `rules_engine_enhanced`, `vat_service`, and `employer_service` modules while maintaining current naming conventions

**Naming Conventions**: Continue using snake_case for Python/Django backend and camelCase for React frontend components

**Coding Standards**: Maintain existing Django REST Framework patterns for API development and React functional component patterns with hooks

**Documentation Standards**: Update existing documentation in docs/ directory with new feature specifications and API documentation

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Utilize existing Django management commands and React build processes without modifications to current CI/CD pipeline

**Deployment Strategy**: Implement database migrations for new features while ensuring zero-downtime deployment compatibility

**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing Django logging for rules engine execution and VAT calculations with appropriate error tracking

**Configuration Management**: Use existing .env configuration patterns for new features like VAT rates and employer integration settings

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- Rules engine complexity may impact system performance
- Mobile layout changes could affect existing desktop functionality
- VAT calculation accuracy depends on complex international tax rules

**Integration Risks**:
- Database schema changes may require careful migration planning
- New API endpoints must maintain backward compatibility
- Frontend responsive changes could break existing user workflows

**Deployment Risks**:
- Rules engine configuration may require production data migration
- Mobile layout testing across multiple devices and browsers
- VAT calculation requires thorough testing with multiple country scenarios

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement rules engine with performance monitoring and caching
- Use progressive enhancement approach for mobile layouts
- Create comprehensive test suite for VAT calculations
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout of new functionality
