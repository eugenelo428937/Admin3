    -- Delivery Address
    delivery_address_type VARCHAR(10) CHECK (delivery_address_type IN ('home', 'work')),
    delivery_address_line1 VARCHAR(255),
    delivery_address_line2 VARCHAR(255),
    delivery_city VARCHAR(100),
    delivery_state VARCHAR(100),
    delivery_postal_code VARCHAR(20),
    delivery_country VARCHAR(100),

    -- Invoice Address

### **üì± RESPONSIVE DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS**

| **Breakpoint** | **Layout Behavior** |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Desktop (>1200px)** | 1/3 summary + 2/3 addresses (side-by-side) |

| **Mobile (<768px)** | Full-width stacked: summary ‚Üí delivery ‚Üí invoice |

### **üîí SECURITY & VALIDATION**

- **Address Data**: Server-side validation using existing address service
- **Phone Numbers**: International format validation with sanitization
