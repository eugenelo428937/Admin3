# Epic 1: Enhanced Rules Engine and User Experience Optimization

**Epic Goal**: Implement a comprehensive rules engine enhancement that serves as the foundation for dynamic VAT calculations and employer-specific messaging, while optimizing the user experience through mobile-responsive design and streamlined registration processes.

**Integration Requirements**: All stories must ensure existing functionality (current VAT calculations, user authentication, product display, cart operations) remains intact while adding new capabilities through the enhanced rules engine framework.

### Story 1.1: Enhanced Rules Engine Foundation with Entry Points

As a system administrator,
I want to configure rule execution entry points throughout the application,
so that business logic can be consistently applied at checkout, product display, VAT calculation, and user registration.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. ‚úÖ Rules engine supports configurable entry points: `home_page_mount`, `product_list_mount`, `product_card_mount`, `checkout_start`, `checkout_preference`, `checkout_terms`, `checkout_payment`,`user_registration`
2. ‚úÖ Entry points can be enabled/disabled without code changes through Django admin
3. ‚úÖ Rule execution performance remains under 200ms per entry point (current: ~20-45ms)
4. ‚úÖ Admin interface allows configuration of which rules execute at each entry point via ActedRule model
5. ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging tracks rule execution and performance metrics with audit trail
6. ‚úÖ Rules engine supports multiple action types including update actions for cart modifications

**Integration Verification**:
- ‚úÖ IV1: Existing VAT calculation functionality continues to work unchanged
- ‚úÖ IV2: Current rules engine features (tutorial booking fees, message display) remain functional
- ‚úÖ IV3: System performance metrics show no degradation in existing workflows

**Implementation Details**:
- **Model**: `ActedRule` (JSONB-based) in `backend/django_Admin3/rules_engine/models/acted_rule.py`
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/rules/engine/execute/`
- **Service**: `RuleEngine` orchestrator in `backend/django_Admin3/rules_engine/services/rule_engine.py`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB storage and performance indexes
- **Admin Interface**: `/admin/rules_engine/actedrule/` for rule management
- **Audit Trail**: `ActedRuleExecution` model logs all executions with context snapshots

**Action Types Supported**:
- `display_message`: Show informational messages to users
- `user_acknowledge`: Require user acknowledgment (e.g., Terms & Conditions)
- `user_preference`: Collect user preferences (optional acknowledgments)
- `update`: ‚úÖ **NEW** - Perform updates to cart, user, or system state
  - `cart.fees` - Add or update cart fees (e.g., tutorial booking fee)
  - `cart.items` - Add or modify cart items (future implementation)

### Story 1.2: Dynamic VAT Calculation System

As a customer,
I want VAT to be calculated automatically based on my location and product type,
so that I see accurate pricing without manual intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. VAT rates are configurable by country and product type through admin interface

3. System supports multiple VAT scenarios (domestic, EU, international)
4. Calculation accuracy is 100% for all supported country/product combinations
5. Fallback to default rates when specific configuration unavailable

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: Existing order processing workflow continues without modification
- IV2: Current pricing display functionality remains unchanged for existing features
- IV3: Cart totals and checkout process maintain existing behavior for current VAT logic

### Story 1.3: Mobile-Responsive Layout Enhancement

As a user on a mobile device,
I want an optimized interface that works seamlessly across all screen sizes,
so that I can browse products and complete purchases efficiently on any device.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Responsive design supports screen widths from 320px to 1920px
2. Touch-friendly navigation and form elements
3. Mobile-optimized product cards and listing layouts
4. Improved checkout flow for mobile users
5. Google PageSpeed score of 90+ on mobile devices

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: Desktop functionality and layouts remain unchanged
- IV2: Existing user workflows continue to work on desktop browsers
- IV3: No performance degradation on desktop or mobile platforms

### Story 1.4: Enhanced User Registration with Employer Integration

As a user registering for an account,
I want a streamlined registration process with employer auto-completion,
so that I can quickly provide accurate information without repetitive data entry.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Registration form includes employer auto-completion with real-time suggestions
2. Progressive disclosure shows relevant fields based on user type
3. Enhanced field validation with clear error messages
4. Employer database integration for accurate company information
5. Maintains backward compatibility with existing user profiles

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: Existing user authentication system continues to work unchanged

- IV3: Login and password reset functionality unaffected

### Story 1.5: [MOVED TO EPIC 2]

**Note**: User Delivery and Contact Details Management has been moved to Epic 2: Order Details and Address Management for better organization and focused implementation.

### Story 1.6: Recommended Products System

As a user browsing products,
I want to see personalized product recommendations,
so that I can discover relevant educational materials more efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Product recommendations appear on relevant pages (product details, cart, profile)
2. Recommendation algorithm considers user history and similar user behaviors
3. Recommendations respect user preferences and subject interests
4. Performance impact minimal on page load times
5. Admin interface for managing recommendation rules

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: Existing product listing and detail pages function unchanged
- IV2: Current search and filtering capabilities remain intact
- IV3: Product display performance maintains existing standards

### Story 1.7: Dynamic Employer Messaging and Contact Display

As a user checking out with an employer code,
I want to see relevant warning messages and employer contact information,
so that I understand any special requirements for my organization.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Employer codes trigger dynamic message display during checkout
2. Warning messages and contact details configured through rules engine
3. Messages appear at appropriate checkout steps based on employer rules
4. Contact information includes relevant department details
5. Message acknowledgment tracking for compliance

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: Existing checkout process works unchanged for users without employer codes
- IV2: Current order processing maintains existing employer code handling
- IV3: Checkout flow performance remains consistent for all user types

### Story 1.8: Tutorial Booking Fee Rule (Update Action Implementation) - **COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

As a system administrator,
I want to automatically add a booking fee for tutorial-only orders paid by credit card,
so that credit card processing costs are covered for small-value orders.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

4. ‚úÖ Rules engine executes at `checkout_payment` entry point when payment method changes
5. ‚úÖ ¬£1 booking fee is added to cart when:
   - Cart contains tutorial items only (no materials or marking)
   - User selects credit card payment method
6. ‚úÖ MUI Snackbar notification displays when booking fee is added
7. ‚úÖ Cart fees are stored in separate `CartFee` model with audit trail

**Implementation Details**:
