## Risk Management

### Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------|
| **Story dependencies block progress** | Medium | High | Plan stories in dependency order, identify critical path | PM |
| **Developer unavailability** | Medium | High | Cross-train team, document work, maintain buffer | Dev Lead |
| **Technical complexity underestimated** | Medium | Medium | Add buffer time, early prototyping, code reviews | Dev Lead |
| **Integration issues between phases** | Low | High | Integration testing after each sprint, CI/CD | QA Lead |
| **Breaking changes in dependencies** | Low | Medium | Lock dependency versions, test before upgrading | Dev 1 |
| **Performance regressions** | Medium | Medium | Performance monitoring (Story 1.15), baseline metrics | Dev 2 |
| **Test flakiness** | High | Low | Proper async handling, cleanup, retry logic | Dev 2 |
| **Documentation becomes outdated** | High | Low | Update docs with code changes, PR checklist | All Devs |
| **Scope creep** | Medium | Medium | Strict story scope, defer enhancements to backlog | PM |
| **Production bugs post-deployment** | Medium | High | Comprehensive testing, staged rollout, rollback plan | Dev Lead |

### Mitigation Strategies

#### For Schedule Risks

1. **Buffer Time**: Each sprint includes 25-67% buffer
2. **Early Warning**: Daily standups to identify blockers
3. **Flexible Scope**: Stories can be deferred if needed
4. **Parallel Work**: Stories 1.11 and 1.12 can run parallel

#### For Technical Risks

1. **Code Reviews**: All PRs reviewed by at least one other developer
2. **Integration Testing**: Test after each sprint
3. **CI/CD**: Automated testing on every commit
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track metrics throughout development

#### For Team Risks

1. **Documentation**: Detailed story documents for each task
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Pair programming, code reviews
3. **Backup Plans**: Stories can be reassigned if needed
4. **Onboarding**: Story 1.18 creates onboarding materials
