# Story 2.3: Modal Address Editor with Smart Input Integration

**Epic**: Epic 2: Order Details and Address Management
**Story ID**: 2.3
**Priority**: Core Functionality - Depends on Story 2.2
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Story Description

As a user reviewing my checkout details,
I want to edit my delivery or invoice addresses through an intuitive modal interface,
so that I can update incorrect information or add new addresses during checkout.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [x] "Edit" button below each address panel opens modal dialog
2. [x] Modal displays `SmartAddressInput` component for country/postcode selection
3. [x] After country/postcode selection, modal shows `DynamicAddressForm`
4. [x] "Enter address manually" option pre-fills form with current address data
5. [x] Modal footer contains "Cancel" (left) and "Update Address" (right) buttons
6. [x] Update Address button triggers profile update confirmation prompt
7. [x] Profile update affects corresponding `acted_user_profile.send_xxx_to` setting
8. [x] Address changes update `acted_user_profile_address` records
9. [x] Modal closes and refreshes address display after successful update

## Integration Verification

- [x] IV1: Existing `SmartAddressInput` and `DynamicAddressForm` components work unchanged
- [x] IV2: Current address validation and formatting logic preserved
- [x] IV3: Profile update mechanisms maintain existing functionality

## Implementation Details

- **Components**:
  - `AddressEditModal` with `SmartAddressInput` integration
  - State management for modal visibility and address editing
  - Integration with existing address validation services
- **Modal Workflow**:
  1. Open modal → Show `SmartAddressInput`
  2. Country selection → Show `DynamicAddressForm`
  3. Form completion → Confirmation prompt
  4. Update → Profile sync → Close modal
- **API Integration**:
  - `PUT /api/users/profile/addresses/{id}/` - update address
  - `PATCH /api/users/profile/` - update address preferences

## Tasks

### Backend Analysis
- [ ] Examine user profile address update API endpoints
- [ ] Verify existing address validation services
- [ ] Check profile preference update mechanisms

### Frontend Implementation

- [ ] Write tests for AddressEditModal component (TDD RED phase)
- [ ] Implement AddressEditModal component (TDD GREEN phase)
- [ ] Integrate modal workflow with existing components (TDD GREEN phase)
- [ ] Add Edit buttons to AddressSelectionPanel
- [ ] Implement profile update confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Refactor and optimize (TDD REFACTOR phase)

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for AddressEditModal component
- [ ] Integration tests with SmartAddressInput and DynamicAddressForm
- [ ] Tests for modal workflow (open/close/save)
- [ ] Tests for profile update functionality
- [ ] Accessibility tests for modal dialogs
