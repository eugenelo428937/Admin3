# Story 2.2: Dynamic Address Selection with Profile Integration

**Epic**: Epic 2: Order Details and Address Management
**Story ID**: 2.2
**Priority**: Core Functionality - Depends on Story 2.1
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Story Description

As a registered user,
I want to select delivery and invoice addresses from my profile settings,
so that I can quickly choose appropriate addresses without re-entering information.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [x] Delivery address panel displays dropdown with "Home" and "Work" options
2. [x] Invoice address panel displays dropdown with "Home" and "Work" options
3. [x] Address selection respects `acted_user_profile.send_study_material_to` setting
4. [x] Invoice selection respects `acted_user_profile.send_invoices_to` setting
5. [x] Address fields auto-populate when dropdown selection changes
6. [x] Address display uses existing `DynamicAddressForm` component for consistent formatting
7. [x] Address fields are initially read-only (non-editable)

## Integration Verification

- [x] IV1: Existing user profile data structure remains intact
- [x] IV2: Current address storage in `acted_user_profile_address` preserved
- [x] IV3: Profile settings API endpoints continue to function unchanged

## Implementation Details

- **Models**:
  - `acted_user_profile.send_invoices_to` (choice: home/work)
  - `acted_user_profile.send_study_material_to` (choice: home/work)
  - `acted_user_profile_address` (existing address storage)
- **Components**:
  - `AddressSelectionPanel` with dropdown integration
  - Integration with `DynamicAddressForm` for display
- **API**:
  - `GET /api/users/profile/addresses/` - retrieve user addresses
  - Profile preference endpoints for address selection

## Tasks

### Backend Analysis
- [ ] Examine user profile models and address relationship
- [ ] Verify existing API endpoints for address retrieval
- [ ] Check profile preference fields

### Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Analyze current CartReviewStep component structure
- [ ] Check existing DynamicAddressForm component
- [ ] Write tests for address selection dropdowns (TDD RED phase)
- [ ] Implement AddressSelectionPanel component (TDD GREEN phase)
- [ ] Integrate dropdowns with profile preferences (TDD GREEN phase)
- [ ] Ensure address auto-population functionality
- [ ] Refactor and optimize (TDD REFACTOR phase)

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for AddressSelectionPanel component
- [ ] Integration tests with profile data
- [ ] Tests for dropdown selection changes
- [ ] Tests for auto-population behavior
- [ ] Accessibility tests for dropdowns
