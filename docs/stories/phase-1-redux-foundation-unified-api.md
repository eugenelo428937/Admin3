# Story 0.1: Redux Foundation and Unified API

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a unified Redux store and API endpoint for all filtering operations,
**so that** we have a single source of truth and consistent data flow for the product filtering system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Redux Toolkit store manages all filter state (subjects, categories, products, variations, search)
2. Single POST `/api/products/search/` endpoint handles all filtering with proper response format
3. RTK Query provides caching and state management for API calls
4. Cookie-based persistence maintains filter state across page reloads
5. Debounced API calls prevent excessive server requests (250ms delay)
6. Disjunctive facet counting implemented (Amazon-style filter counts)
7. Database indexes added for optimal performance
8. Navigation menu special behaviors implemented in Redux actions

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **Backend**: `backend/django_Admin3/exam_sessions_subjects_products/` - Current filtering logic location
- **Frontend**: `frontend/react-Admin3/src/services/productService.js` - Existing product API service
- **Frontend**: `frontend/react-Admin3/src/components/Product/ProductList.js` - 1000+ line component to be refactored in Phase 2
- **Frontend**: `frontend/react-Admin3/package.json` - Dependencies management
- **Frontend**: `frontend/react-Admin3/src/store/` - New Redux store location

### Implementation Context
- Current filtering system has multiple sources of truth causing state inconsistencies
- ProductList.js has grown to 1000+ lines with complex, brittle state management
- Parameter mismatches exist: Frontend sends `subject`, backend expects `SUBJECT_FILTER`
- Existing filter service is bypassed by manual filtering logic
- Multiple useEffect loops cause infinite re-renders
- No state persistence - filters don't survive page reloads

### Technical Requirements
- Redux Toolkit for state management with proper slice patterns
- RTK Query for API caching and data fetching
- js-cookie library for cookie persistence
- Database migration for new indexes with CONCURRENTLY to avoid blocking production
- Response time < 200ms for typical filter queries
- Cookie expiration set to 30 days
- Use existing productService.js as reference for API patterns
- Follow coding standards for Redux Toolkit patterns from coding-standards.md
- Ensure backward compatibility during transition

### Key Architecture Points
- Single POST `/api/products/search/` endpoint replaces multiple endpoints
- Disjunctive facet counting (Amazon-style) for filter counts
- Cookie-based persistence instead of URL-based
- Navigation menu special behaviors implemented as Redux actions
- Debounced API calls with 250ms delay to prevent excessive requests

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- **Backend Tests**: `backend/django_Admin3/exam_sessions_subjects_products/tests.py`
- **Frontend Tests**: `frontend/react-Admin3/src/**/*.test.js` (co-located with components)
- **Integration Tests**: `frontend/react-Admin3/src/services/__tests__/`

### Testing Standards
- **Backend**: Use Django `APITestCase` for API endpoint testing
- **Backend**: Use `force_authenticate()` for authenticated tests
- **Backend**: Mock external dependencies
- **Frontend**: Use React Testing Library for component testing
- **Frontend**: Use Jest for test runner and assertions
- **Frontend**: Mock API calls in component tests

### Testing Frameworks
- **Django**: Built-in TestCase and APITestCase
- **React**: React Testing Library + Jest
- **API Testing**: Django REST Framework test utilities

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for Redux slices, actions, and reducers
- Integration tests for API endpoint with various filter combinations
- Performance tests for database queries with new indexes
- Cookie persistence tests across browser sessions
- Debounce functionality tests for search hook
- Error handling tests for API failures
