# Phase 3: Database Performance Optimization

## Story Overview

**Story ID**: Phase 3 - Database Performance Optimization  
**Epic**: Epic 0 - Product Filtering System Redesign  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimate**: 0.5 weeks

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

As a system administrator,  
I want optimized database queries and proper indexing,  
So that filtering operations perform efficiently at scale.

## Story Description

This story focuses on optimizing database performance for the newly redesigned filtering system. With Phase 1 providing unified API endpoints and Phase 2 delivering clean component architecture, Phase 3 ensures the database layer can handle filtering operations efficiently at scale with proper indexing and query optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC1**: Critical database indexes added for filter performance
- GIVEN the current database schema without optimized indexes
- WHEN filtering operations are performed frequently
- THEN critical indexes should be added for exam_sessions_subjects_products table
- AND indexes should improve query performance by > 50%

**AC2**: Database queries optimized using proper JOINs
- GIVEN the current filtering queries may be suboptimal
- WHEN users apply multiple filter combinations
- THEN queries should use proper JOINs instead of subqueries
- AND eliminate N+1 query problems

**AC3**: Query response times < 200ms for typical filter combinations
- GIVEN the performance target of sub-200ms response times
- WHEN users apply common filter combinations
- THEN 95% of filter queries should complete in < 200ms
- AND complex multi-filter queries should complete in < 500ms

**AC4**: Database migration scripts handle index creation safely
- GIVEN production database constraints
- WHEN applying database migrations
- THEN migration scripts should create indexes without blocking operations
- AND include proper rollback procedures

**AC5**: Query performance monitoring implemented
- GIVEN the need for ongoing performance visibility
- WHEN filtering operations are performed
- THEN query performance should be logged and monitored
- AND slow queries should be identified and alerted

## Technical Requirements

- Add indexes on exam_sessions_subjects_products for filtering columns

- **Full-text search with filters**: < 300ms
- **Filter counts calculation**: < 100ms

### Database Optimization Targets

- **Connection pooling**: Optimize database connection usage
- **Memory usage**: Efficient index sizing and query memory allocation

## Definition of Ready

- [x] All acceptance criteria verified
- [x] Database indexes created and tested
- [x] Query performance targets met (< 200ms for 95% of operations)
- [x] Migration scripts tested and deployed
- [x] Performance monitoring implemented and functioning
- [x] Performance regression tests passing
- [x] Documentation updated for database optimizations

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Database Tables
- `exam_sessions_subjects_products` - Main table for filtering operations
- `acted_product_group` - Product grouping relationships
- `acted_filter_group` - Filter group definitions (may need cleanup)
- `products` - Master product catalog
- `subjects` - Subject definitions

### Current Performance Issues
Based on Phase 1 and Phase 2 analysis, likely performance bottlenecks:
- Missing indexes on frequently queried filter columns
- Suboptimal JOIN strategies in complex filter queries
- N+1 query problems when loading related data
- Inefficient filter count calculations
- No query performance monitoring

### Index Strategy
- **Single column indexes**: Most frequently filtered columns
- **Composite indexes**: Common filter combinations (subject + category, etc.)
- **Covering indexes**: Include all columns needed for filter queries
- **Partial indexes**: For active/available products only

### Query Optimization Focus Areas
- Unified search endpoint query generation
- Filter count calculations (faceted search)
- Related product data loading
- Session-based product filtering
- Search + filter combination queries

### Monitoring Requirements
- Query execution time logging
- Index usage statistics
- Slow query identification
- Database connection pool metrics
- Cache hit/miss ratios for filter data
