## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As a customer** shopping for exam preparation materials,
**I want** to easily purchase complementary products together (like buying both eBook and printed versions, or adding marking services to mock exams),
**So that** I can complete my study materials in a single transaction without searching for related products separately.

**As a store administrator**,
**I want** to define which products should be recommended together,
**So that** customers discover complementary offerings that enhance their learning experience and increase sales through effective cross-selling.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am viewing a product with multiple format options (eBook and Printed),
   **When** the product is configured to allow "buy both" purchases,
   **Then** I see a clear action to purchase both formats together in one click.

2. **Given** I am viewing a product variation (like Mock Exam eBook),
   **When** a complementary product (like Mock Exam Marking service) has been recommended for it,
   **Then** I see an action to purchase both products together with the recommended product name and price displayed.

3. **Given** I select a product variation that has no complementary recommendations,
   **When** I view the purchase options,
   **Then** I see only the standard single-product purchase action.

4. **Given** I am a store administrator,
   **When** I want to create a product recommendation,
   **Then** I can define which product variation recommends which complementary product variation with a one-to-one relationship.

5. **Given** I am a customer,
   **When** I choose to purchase a bundle (buy both or with recommendation),
   **Then** both products are added to my cart with correct pricing and metadata preserved.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a product has both "buy both" capability and product recommendations? **Answer**: "Buy both" takes precedence; recommendations are not shown for products with buy_both enabled.

- How does the system handle missing price information for recommended products? **Answer**: System falls back to displaying the first available price if standard pricing is unavailable.

- What happens to product recommendations when the source or recommended product is deleted? **Answer**: The recommendation relationship is automatically removed to maintain data integrity.

- How are circular recommendations prevented (Product A recommends B, B recommends A)? **Answer**: System validates and prevents circular recommendation configurations at the administrative level.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Product Recommendation Management:**

- **FR-001**: Store administrators MUST be able to define complementary product recommendations, mapping one product variation to exactly one recommended product variation.

- **FR-002**: System MUST prevent a product variation from recommending itself.

- **FR-003**: System MUST prevent circular recommendations where Product A recommends Product B and Product B recommends Product A.

- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain referential integrity - when a product variation is deleted, associated recommendations MUST be automatically removed.

**Purchase Experience - Buy Both:**

- **FR-005**: When a product is configured with "buy both" capability and has two or more variations, customers MUST see purchase options for buying a single variation OR buying both primary variations together.

- **FR-006**: System MUST remove the current radio button selection interface for "buy both" products and replace it with an enhanced action menu.

**Purchase Experience - Recommended Products:**

- **FR-007**: When a customer selects a product variation that has a recommended complementary product, they MUST see purchase options for the selected product alone OR together with the recommended product.

- **FR-008**: The recommended product purchase option MUST display the recommended product's name and standard price clearly (e.g., "Buy with Mock Exam Marking (¬£73)").

- **FR-009**: If "buy both" is enabled for a product, the system MUST NOT display product recommendations (buy both takes priority).

**Purchase Experience - Fallback:**

- **FR-010**: When a product has neither "buy both" capability nor product recommendations, customers MUST see the standard single-product purchase action.

- **FR-011**: All purchase actions (single, buy both, with recommendation) MUST maintain existing shopping cart behavior including pricing, discounts, and product metadata.

**Data Requirements:**

- **FR-012**: System MUST support storing product variation recommendations with creation and update timestamps for audit purposes.

- **FR-013**: System MUST provide administrative interface for managing product recommendations with filtering and search capabilities.

**API Requirements:**

- **FR-014**: Product search responses MUST include recommendation data when available, formatted as optional nested information within product variations.

- **FR-015**: API changes MUST be backward compatible - existing consumers that don't use recommendation data MUST continue to function without modification.

### Key Entities

- **Product Recommendation**: Represents a one-to-one relationship between a source product variation and a recommended complementary product variation. Contains identifiers for both products, timestamps for tracking, and ensures data integrity through cascade deletion.

- **Product Variation**: Different versions or formats of a product (e.g., eBook, Printed, Marking service). Can have at most one outgoing recommendation to another product variation. Already exists in the system; this feature extends it with recommendation capability.

- **Shopping Cart**: Customer's collection of selected products for purchase. Maintains product metadata, pricing information, and discount eligibility. Existing functionality must be preserved when adding products via new purchase options.

## Success Metrics

### User Experience Improvements
- Reduced number of clicks required to purchase multiple related products (from 2 separate purchases to 1 bundled action)
- Improved discoverability of complementary products through contextual recommendations
- Clearer purchase options following modern design patterns

### Business Value
- Increased average order value through effective cross-selling
- Higher conversion rate for bundle purchases
- Improved product recommendation engagement and visibility

### System Quality
- Zero regression in existing product display and purchase functionality
- Backward compatible changes that don't impact existing API consumers
- Data integrity maintained through proper relationship management

---

## Assumptions & Constraints

### Business Rules
1. A product variation can recommend at most one other product variation (one-to-one relationship)
2. Products with "buy both" enabled will not display product recommendations (mutual exclusivity)
3. Standard pricing is the default for displaying recommended product prices in purchase options
4. Recommendations only display for the currently selected product variation

### Technical Constraints
1. Product recommendation data storage must support efficient retrieval with minimal performance impact
2. Changes must be backward compatible with existing API consumers
3. Administrative interface must follow existing patterns for managing product data
4. All existing shopping cart functionality must be preserved without modification

### Scope Boundaries
- This feature does NOT modify existing shopping cart calculation logic
- This feature does NOT change how products are priced or discounts are applied
- This feature does NOT alter existing product variation management beyond adding recommendation capability
- This feature does NOT introduce dynamic or algorithmic product recommendations (only manual administrator-defined recommendations)

---

## Dependencies

### Existing Functionality
- Product variation system (must support additional relationship to recommended products)
- Shopping cart system (must continue to function with products added via new purchase options)
- Product search/listing API (must be extended to include recommendation data)
- Administrative product management interface (must be extended for recommendation management)

### External Systems
- None - this is an internal enhancement to existing product management and shopping functionality
