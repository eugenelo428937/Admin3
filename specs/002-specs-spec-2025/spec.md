## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **Rules Engine**, I need granular custom functions for VAT calculations, so that I can compose complex VAT rules from simple, testable, reusable building blocks without requiring hardcoded Python calculation logic in application code.

As a **finance administrator**, I need VAT rates to be looked up from the database dynamically, so that I can update rates through the admin interface without code changes.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Lookup VAT Region for UK Customer**
- **Given** a customer with country code 'GB' and current effective date
- **When** `lookup_region('GB')` is called by a Rules Engine rule
- **Then** the function returns 'UK' by querying UtilsCountryRegion
- **And** the query respects effective_from and effective_to date ranges

**Scenario 2: Get VAT Rate for South Africa**
- **Given** a customer in South Africa with country code 'ZA'
- **When** `lookup_vat_rate('ZA')` is called by a Rules Engine rule
- **Then** the function returns Decimal('0.15') (15% as decimal) from UtilsCountrys.vat_percent
- **And** the rate is current from the database, not hardcoded

**Scenario 3: Calculate VAT Amount for ¬£100 Net at 20%**
- **Given** a net amount of Decimal('100.00') and VAT rate Decimal('0.20')
- **When** `calculate_vat_amount(100.00, 0.20)` is called by a Rules Engine rule
- **Then** the function returns Decimal('20.00') with ROUND_HALF_UP rounding
- **And** the result has exactly 2 decimal places

**Scenario 4: Handle Unknown Country Code**
- **Given** a customer with invalid or unmapped country code 'XX'
- **When** `lookup_region('XX')` is called
- **Then** the function returns 'ROW' (Rest of World) as default
- **And** no exception is raised

**Scenario 5: Handle Country with No VAT Rate**
- **Given** a country exists in database but has no VAT rate configured
- **When** `lookup_vat_rate('XX')` is called
- **Then** the function returns Decimal('0.00') as safe default
- **And** no exception is raised

### Edge Cases
- What happens when effective_date is in the past and region mapping has changed?
  - Function queries UtilsCountryRegion with date filter, returns historical region
- How does the system handle fractional VAT rates (e.g., 5.5%)?
  - Function converts percentage to decimal (Decimal('0.055')) with proper precision
- What if net_amount is zero?
  - calculate_vat_amount returns Decimal('0.00') correctly
- How are negative amounts handled?
  - Caller validation responsibility - functions process negative amounts mathematically
- What if UtilsCountrys.vat_percent is NULL?
  - Function treats NULL as 0, returns Decimal('0.00')

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Custom Function (lookup_region)**: Queries UtilsCountryRegion to map country ISO codes to VAT regions. Takes country_code (string) and optional effective_date (date). Returns region code string or 'ROW' default. Registered in FUNCTION_REGISTRY for Rules Engine access.

- **Custom Function (lookup_vat_rate)**: Queries UtilsCountrys.vat_percent to get current VAT rate for a country. Takes country_code (string). Returns Decimal VAT rate (e.g., 0.20 for 20%) or Decimal('0.00') default. Registered in FUNCTION_REGISTRY.

- **Custom Function (calculate_vat_amount)**: Pure calculation function for VAT amount from net amount and rate. Takes net_amount (Decimal) and vat_rate (Decimal). Returns VAT amount (Decimal) with ROUND_HALF_UP to 2 decimal places. Registered in FUNCTION_REGISTRY.

- **FUNCTION_REGISTRY**: Dictionary mapping function names (strings) to callable function objects. Updated with new VAT functions. Used by Rules Engine to dynamically invoke custom functions by name from rule definitions.

- **UtilsCountryRegion** (existing): Database model linking countries to VAT regions with date ranges. Used by lookup_region for database queries. Contains country FK, region FK, effective_from, effective_to fields.

- **UtilsCountrys** (existing): Database model storing VAT rates per country. Used by lookup_vat_rate for database queries. Contains country code, name, vat_percent (Decimal), active (Boolean) fields.
