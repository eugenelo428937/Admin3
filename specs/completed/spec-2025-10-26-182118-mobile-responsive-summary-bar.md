## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **mobile tutorial purchaser**, I want the tutorial summary bar to be collapsible and not obstruct my screen on mobile devices, so that I can easily review my tutorial selections without losing visibility of the tutorial catalog and other page content.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Mobile Compact View (screens < 900px)
1. **Given** user is on mobile device (screen width < 900px), **When** tutorial summary bar appears, **Then** summary bar displays in compact mode with:
   - Collapsed state by default (single line with subject code)
   - Positioned to not obstruct main content
   - Easy-to-tap expand button visible
   - Maximum width optimized for small screens

#### Desktop Full View (screens ‚â• 900px)
2. **Given** user is on desktop (screen width ‚â• 900px), **When** tutorial summary bar appears, **Then** summary bar displays in full mode (current behavior):
   - Expanded by default showing all choices
   - Positioned at bottom-left as currently implemented
   - All action buttons visible
   - Maximum width 24rem (current design)

#### Mobile Expand/Collapse Interaction
3. **Given** summary bar is collapsed on mobile, **When** user taps on collapsed bar or expand icon, **Then** bar expands smoothly to show:
   - All tutorial choices (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
   - Edit, Add to Cart, Remove buttons
   - Collapse button
   - Smooth animation
   - Expanded bar doesn't obstruct screen content

#### Touch Target Accessibility
4. **Given** user interacts with summary bar on mobile, **When** tapping any action button, **Then**:
   - Touch target is minimum 44px √ó 44px
   - Buttons have adequate spacing (8px minimum)
   - Tap areas don't overlap or cause mis-taps

#### Responsive Breakpoint Consistency
5. **Given** user resizes browser window or rotates device, **When** crossing the 900px breakpoint (md), **Then**:
   - Summary bar smoothly transitions between mobile and desktop modes
   - State is preserved (selected tutorials remain)
   - No visual glitches or layout shifts

### Edge Cases
- **What happens when multiple subjects have tutorial selections on mobile?**
  - Each subject's summary bar should stack vertically
  - Each maintains independent collapse/expand state
  - Total height doesn't exceed 50% of viewport

- **How does system handle z-index conflicts with other fixed elements?**
  - Summary bar (z-index: 1200) doesn't block SpeedDial (z-index: 1050)
  - Modal dialogs (z-index: 1300) appear above summary bar
  - No visual overlapping or interaction blocking

- **What happens during collapse/expand animation if user navigates away?**
  - Animation completes or cancels gracefully
  - No error states or stuck animations
  - State persists for next page visit

- **How does reduced motion preference affect animations?**
  - System respects `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS media query
  - Instant show/hide instead of smooth transition
  - Functionality remains identical

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Mobile Behavior (< 900px)

- **FR-005**: System MUST animate expand/collapse transitions smoothly at 60fps minimum
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent summary bar from obstructing main content (tutorial catalog, navigation)
- **FR-007**: System MUST position summary bar at bottom of viewport on mobile devices
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure summary bar uses full viewport width on mobile (minus safe margins)

#### Desktop Behavior (‚â• 900px)
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain current desktop behavior unchanged for screens 900px and wider
- **FR-010**: System MUST display summary bar expanded by default on desktop
- **FR-011**: System MUST position summary bar at bottom-left on desktop
- **FR-012**: System MUST limit summary bar maximum width to 24rem on desktop

#### Touch Interaction & Accessibility
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide touch targets of minimum 44px √ó 44px for all interactive elements
- **FR-014**: System MUST space interactive buttons with minimum 8px gaps on mobile
- **FR-015**: System MUST prevent tap area overlap between adjacent buttons
- **FR-016**: System MUST support keyboard navigation (Tab to focus, Enter/Space to activate)
- **FR-017**: System MUST announce expand/collapse state changes to screen readers
- **FR-018**: System MUST respect user's reduced motion preference (disable animations)

#### Multi-Subject Behavior
- **FR-019**: System MUST stack multiple subject summary bars vertically on mobile
- **FR-020**: System MUST maintain independent collapse/expand state for each subject's summary bar
- **FR-021**: System MUST limit total expanded summary bars height to maximum 50% of viewport

#### Integration & Performance
- **FR-022**: System MUST maintain z-index hierarchy: modals (1300) > summary bar (1200) > SpeedDial (1050)
- **FR-023**: System MUST preserve tutorial selection data during responsive transitions
- **FR-024**: System MUST complete expand/collapse animations without layout shift
- **FR-025**: System MUST hide summary bar when no tutorial selections remain
- **FR-026**: System MUST maintain all existing functionality (Edit, Add to Cart, Remove buttons)

### Key Entities *(data involved)*

- **Tutorial Summary Bar**: Represents a summary of user's tutorial selections for a single subject
  - Attributes: subject code, tutorial choices (1st, 2nd, 3rd), collapse state
  - Relationships: One summary bar per subject with selections

- **Tutorial Selection**: Represents a user's choice priority for a tutorial
  - Attributes: choice priority (1st, 2nd, 3rd), tutorial event details
  - Relationships: Multiple selections belong to one subject summary

- **Viewport State**: Represents current device/browser viewport characteristics
  - Attributes: width, height, breakpoint category (xs/sm/md/lg/xl)
  - Relationships: Determines summary bar display mode

---

## Out of Scope

- **Custom mobile UI designs beyond bottom sheet/slide-up panel**: Only implementing responsive adaptations of existing summary bar
- **Mobile-specific features**: No swipe gestures, pinch-to-zoom, or mobile-only controls
- **Complete mobile app redesign**: This is a brownfield addition, not a full mobile overhaul
- **Backend changes**: All changes are frontend presentation layer only
- **New tutorial selection logic**: Only making existing summary bar responsive, not changing functionality

---

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Existing TutorialSelectionSummaryBar component (frontend/react-Admin3/src/components/Product/ProductCard/Tutorial/TutorialSelectionSummaryBar.js)
- Material-UI v5 responsive design system (theme.breakpoints)
- Existing touch interaction patterns (tutorialStyles.js)

### Assumptions
- Material-UI breakpoints remain: xs (0px), sm (600px), md (900px), lg (1200px), xl (1536px)
- Touch target minimum size standard: 44px √ó 44px (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Desktop viewport defined as ‚â• 900px width (md breakpoint)
- Mobile viewport defined as < 900px width (xs, sm breakpoints)
- Users have modern browsers supporting CSS media queries and transforms

## Notes for Planning Phase

When creating the implementation plan from this spec:

1. **Preserve Desktop Behavior**: Any implementation approach MUST ensure desktop experience (md+) remains unchanged
2. **Touch Accessibility**: All interactive elements MUST meet 44px √ó 44px minimum (automated tests should verify this)
3. **Performance Constraints**: Animations MUST run at 60fps (use CSS transforms, not height animations)
4. **Breakpoint Strategy**: Use Material-UI `theme.breakpoints.down('md')` for mobile detection
5. **Testing Requirements**: Plan must include cross-device testing checklist and accessibility validation
6. **Design Options**: Story provides three design options (Bottom Sheet, Slide-Up Panel, Floating Widget) - planning phase should select one based on implementation feasibility
