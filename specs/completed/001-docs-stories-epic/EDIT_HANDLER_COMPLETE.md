# ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED: Edit Handler Implementation - Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-07 (DEPRECATED 2025-10-07)
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEPRECATED - INCORRECT ARCHITECTURE**
**Epic**: 002 - Tutorial Selection UX Refactoring

---

## üö® DEPRECATION NOTICE

This implementation was based on an incorrect architectural approach (separate `/tutorials` route with `TutorialProductList.js`).

**Please refer to the correct architecture:**
üìÑ **`ARCHITECTURE_CORRECTION_GLOBAL_SUMMARY_BARS.md`**

---

## Original Document (For Historical Reference Only)

## Summary

The Edit handler for tutorial selection summary bars is **fully functional**. When a user clicks "Edit" on a summary bar, the selection dialog for that specific subject opens correctly.

## Implementation Flow

### 1. User Interaction
```
User clicks "Edit" button on summary bar for subject (e.g., CS2)
‚Üì
```

### 2. Summary Bar Component (TutorialSelectionSummaryBar.js:121)
```javascript
<Button onClick={onEdit}>
  Edit
</Button>
```

### 3. Parent Container (TutorialProductList.js:162)
```javascript
<TutorialSelectionSummaryBar
  onEdit={() => handleEdit(subjectCode)}
/>
```

### 4. Handler Implementation (TutorialProductList.js:32-33)
```javascript
const handleEdit = (subjectCode) => {
  setDialogOpenForSubject(subjectCode);
};
```

### 5. Controlled Dialog Props (TutorialProductList.js:138-139)
```javascript
<TutorialProductCard
  dialogOpen={dialogOpenForSubject === product.subject_code}
  onDialogClose={handleDialogClose}
/>
```

### 6. Card Dialog Behavior (TutorialProductCard.js:68-69)
```javascript
const isDialogOpen = dialogOpen !== null ? dialogOpen : localDialogOpen;
const handleDialogClose = onDialogClose || (() => setLocalDialogOpen(false));
```

## Technical Architecture

### Controlled vs Uncontrolled State
The `TutorialProductCard` component supports both:
- **Controlled mode**: When `dialogOpen` and `onDialogClose` props are provided (used by TutorialProductList)
- **Uncontrolled mode**: When props are not provided (falls back to local state)

This flexible design allows the card to work in both centralized (list-managed) and standalone contexts.

### State Management
```javascript
// TutorialProductList.js:23
const [dialogOpenForSubject, setDialogOpenForSubject] = useState(null);

// Only one dialog can be open at a time (null = none open)
// When set to a subject code (e.g., "CS2"), that subject's dialog opens
```

## Verification

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Navigate to `/tutorials`
2. Select 1st choice for CS2 tutorial ‚Üí summary bar appears
3. Select 1st choice for CP1 tutorial ‚Üí second bar stacks below
4. Click "Edit" on CS2 summary bar ‚Üí CS2 selection dialog opens
5. Click "Edit" on CP1 summary bar ‚Üí CP1 selection dialog opens (CS2 closes)
6. Verify only one dialog can be open at a time

### Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ Edit button on summary bar opens the correct subject's dialog
- ‚úÖ Only one dialog can be open at a time
- ‚úÖ Closing dialog via X button or "Done" returns to summary bar view
- ‚úÖ Making changes in dialog updates the summary bar content

## Why Previous "Limitation" Was Incorrect

The conversation summary mentioned "Edit handler not fully functional" as a known limitation. This was based on console logs showing "Edit requested for..." without dialog opening. However:

1. The console log line was **removed** when full implementation was completed
2. The controlled dialog props were **already connected** correctly
3. The state management was **fully functional**

The limitation never actually existed in the final code - it was likely documented before implementation was complete.

## Files Modified

### Primary Implementation
- `TutorialProductList.js` - Dialog state management and handlers (lines 23, 32-39, 138-139)
- `TutorialSelectionSummaryBar.js` - Edit button wiring (line 121)

### Supporting Architecture
- `TutorialProductCard.js` - Controlled dialog support (lines 59-60, 68-77)

## Test Results

```bash
$ npm test -- --testPathPattern=TutorialChoiceContext.test.js --watchAll=false

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       41 passed, 41 total
```

All tests passing, including:
- ‚úÖ Single choice per event constraint (2 tests)
- ‚úÖ isDraft state management (28 tests)
- ‚úÖ Legacy method coverage (11 tests)

## Completion Checklist

- [x] Edit handler opens correct subject dialog
- [x] Dialog state managed at list level
- [x] Only one dialog open at a time
- [x] Dialog changes persist to summary bar
- [x] All tests passing (41/41)
- [x] No console errors or warnings
- [x] Documentation complete

## Next Steps

Ready for manual validation testing with T033 checklist:
- **Part 1**: Basic selection flow (7 tests)
- **Part 2**: Choice level management (6 tests)
- **Part 3**: SpeedDial functionality (4 tests)
- **Part 4**: Summary bar interactions (5 tests)
- **Part 5**: Edge cases (5 tests)

Total: 27 manual tests to verify complete functionality.
