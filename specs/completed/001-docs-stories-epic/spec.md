## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
**Problem:** When students select tutorial courses, the current interface has several UX issues that make the selection process confusing and difficult, especially on mobile devices:
1. Tutorial event details and selection controls are mixed together, making cards cluttered
2. Choice selection feedback is unclear - students can't easily see which choices they've selected
3. Summary of selected choices is not visible while browsing, requiring students to remember their selections
4. Price information button doesn't work, leaving students unable to see pricing details
5. Layout doesn't adapt well to mobile and tablet screens
6. SpeedDial button behavior is inconsistent and confusing

**Solution:** Refactor the tutorial selection interface to improve usability through clear component separation, intuitive visual feedback, responsive layouts, and a persistent summary bar that shows all selected choices.

**User Journey:**
1. Student navigates to tutorials page and sees tutorial products displayed in cards
2. Student hovers over a tutorial card and sees SpeedDial expand with "Select Tutorial" and "Price Info" options
3. Student clicks "Select Tutorial" and sees a dialog with tutorial events displayed in a responsive grid (3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile)
4. Each tutorial event is shown in a clean detail card with event information clearly separated from selection buttons
5. Student clicks "1st Choice" button on a tutorial event - button changes appearance to show it's selected (filled/contained style)
6. A summary bar appears at the bottom showing "CS2 Tutorials: 1st Choice - Bristol (TUT-CS2-BRI-001)"
7. Student continues browsing and selects a 2nd choice - summary bar updates to show both choices
8. Student can click "Edit" in summary bar to modify choices, "Add to Cart" to proceed, or "Remove" to clear selections
9. After adding to cart, summary bar collapses to a single line showing "CS2 Tutorials [Edit]"
10. Student clicks "Price Info" on any tutorial card and sees variation-specific pricing table in a modal

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Tutorial detail card displays event information clearly**
- **Given** student opens tutorial selection dialog
- **When** student views tutorial event cards
- **Then** each card shows event title, code, location, dates, and venue in a consistent layout
- **And** selection buttons (1st/2nd/3rd) are visually separated from event details
- **And** cards maintain fixed dimensions for consistent grid alignment

**Scenario 2: Choice selection provides clear visual feedback**
- **Given** student is viewing tutorial events in selection dialog
- **When** student clicks "1st Choice" button on an event
- **Then** button changes from outlined style to contained (filled) style with white text
- **And** student can clearly distinguish selected from unselected choices
- **And** previously selected choice at that level (if any) changes back to outlined style

**Scenario 3: Summary bar shows selected choices while browsing**
- **Given** student has selected 1st and 2nd choices for CS2 tutorials
- **When** student is browsing tutorial events
- **Then** summary bar displays at bottom of screen showing:
  - Subject title "CS2 Tutorials"
  - Ordered list: "1. 1st Choice - Bristol (TUT-CS2-BRI-001)"
  - Ordered list: "2. 2nd Choice - London (TUT-CS2-LON-002)"
  - Action buttons: Edit, Add to Cart, Remove

**Scenario 4: Summary bar collapses after adding to cart**
- **Given** student has selected 2 tutorial choices (both draft state)
- **When** student clicks "Add to Cart" in summary bar
- **Then** choices are added to cart (isDraft: false)
- **And** summary bar collapses to single line showing "CS2 Tutorials [Edit] [X]"
- **And** expanded details are hidden until student clicks Edit

**Scenario 5: Responsive layout adapts to screen size**
- **Given** student is viewing tutorial selection dialog
- **When** student views on desktop (large screen)
- **Then** tutorial detail cards are displayed in 3-column grid
- **When** student views on tablet (medium screen)
- **Then** tutorial detail cards are displayed in 2-column grid
- **When** student views on mobile (small screen)
- **Then** tutorial detail cards are displayed in 1-column grid

**Scenario 6: Price info displays variation-specific pricing**
- **Given** student is viewing tutorial product card
- **When** student clicks "Price Info" button on SpeedDial
- **Then** modal/popover opens showing pricing table
- **And** table displays all tutorial variations with their respective prices
- **And** student can see which variation applies to each tutorial format

**Scenario 7: SpeedDial behavior is consistent and intuitive**
- **Given** student is viewing tutorial product card
- **When** student hovers mouse over SpeedDial button
- **Then** SpeedDial expands to show action buttons
- **When** student clicks an action button (Select Tutorial or Price Info)
- **Then** SpeedDial collapses and executes the action
- **When** student moves mouse away from SpeedDial
- **Then** SpeedDial collapses back to closed state

**Scenario 8: Summary bar allows editing and removal**
- **Given** student has selected tutorial choices shown in summary bar
- **When** student clicks "Edit" button in summary bar
- **Then** tutorial selection dialog opens with current choices pre-selected
- **When** student clicks "Remove" button in summary bar
- **Then** all draft choices for that subject are cleared
- **And** summary bar for that subject disappears

### Edge Cases

**Edge Case 1: Multiple subjects with different choice counts**
- What happens when student selects 3 choices for CS2 and 1 choice for CP1?
- **Expected:** Two separate summary bars display - one for CS2 (expanded showing 3 choices), one for CP1 (expanded showing 1 choice)

**Edge Case 2: Summary bar with mixed draft and carted states**
- What happens when student has 2 choices in cart (isDraft: false) and adds a 3rd draft choice?
- **Expected:** Summary bar shows all 3 choices in expanded state until all are added to cart, then collapses

**Edge Case 3: Screen size changes during selection**
- What happens when student rotates device from portrait to landscape during tutorial selection?
- **Expected:** Grid layout smoothly transitions from 1-column to 2-column (or vice versa) maintaining scroll position

**Edge Case 4: No tutorial events available for selection**
- What happens when dialog opens but no tutorial events are available?
- **Expected:** Dialog displays message "No tutorial events available at this time" with option to close

**Edge Case 5: SpeedDial with keyboard navigation**
- How does SpeedDial behave when student uses keyboard instead of mouse?
- **Expected:** Tab focuses SpeedDial button, Enter/Space expands it, arrow keys navigate actions, Escape collapses it
