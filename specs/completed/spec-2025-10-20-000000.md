## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
**As a user**, I want my search filter selections to persist when I close and reopen the search modal, so that I can refine my search without losing my previous selections.

**As a developer**, I want all search filter state visible in debugging tools, so that I can diagnose and fix search reliability issues more effectively.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the user opens the search modal and selects filters (CB1 subject, Materials product group), **When** the user closes the search modal and reopens it, **Then** the previously selected filters (CB1, Materials) are still active.

2. **Given** the user has selected search filters, **When** the user types a search query "mock pack", **Then** the search query persists across modal close/reopen cycles.

3. **Given** the user has selected filters in the search modal, **When** the user clicks "Show Matching Products", **Then** the user is navigated to the products page with the search filters applied to the product list.

4. **Given** the user selects and deselects filters rapidly, **When** the filter state updates, **Then** the system handles the rapid changes without lag or state inconsistency.

5. **Given** the user is on the products page with filters already applied, **When** the user opens the search modal, **Then** the current filters are pre-selected in the search modal.

6. **Given** a developer is debugging search issues, **When** the user interacts with search filters, **Then** all filter state changes are visible in debugging tools with complete action history.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user selects filters, navigates away from the site, and returns? (Filter state should persist based on storage strategy)
- How does the system handle filter selections when the search modal component unmounts and remounts multiple times in quick succession? (State must remain consistent)
- What happens if the user has conflicting filter selections from different entry points (e.g., navigation menu vs search modal)? (Single source of truth should resolve conflicts)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Filter State Management**:
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain search filter selections when the search modal is closed and reopened within the same session
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain the search query text when the search modal is closed and reopened
- **FR-003**: System MUST update filter state immediately when users check or uncheck filter options (< 50ms response time)
- **FR-004**: System MUST support all existing filter types (subjects, product groups, variations, products) without regression

**Search Modal Interaction**:
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to select multiple filters across different filter categories simultaneously
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to clear individual filter selections
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to navigate to the products page with selected filters applied via "Show Matching Products" button
- **FR-008**: System MUST pre-populate search modal filters based on currently active filters when modal is opened

**State Persistence and Consistency**:
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain a single source of truth for all search filter state
- **FR-010**: System MUST synchronize filter state between the search modal, filter panel, and products list
- **FR-011**: System MUST persist filter selections across component mount/unmount cycles
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain filter state consistency during rapid filter selection changes

**Developer Experience**:
- **FR-013**: System MUST make all filter state changes visible in developer debugging tools
- **FR-014**: System MUST log all filter state change actions with complete action history
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide complete state snapshots at any point in time for debugging purposes

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- **NFR-001**: Filter checkbox click response time MUST be less than 50ms
- **NFR-002**: Search modal render time MUST not increase by more than 5ms compared to current implementation
- **NFR-003**: System MUST handle rapid filter selection changes (> 10 clicks per second) without lag or dropped updates
- **NFR-004**: All existing search functionality MUST continue to work identically to current behavior

### Key Entities

- **Search Filter State**: Represents the current filter selections including subjects, categories, product types, products, variations, and search query text. This state must be centrally managed and accessible throughout the application.

- **Search Modal Session**: Represents a user's interaction with the search modal, including filter selections made during the session. This state must persist across modal open/close cycles within the same session.

- **Filter Selection Action**: Represents a user action to add or remove a filter. Each action must be logged and traceable for debugging purposes.

## Success Criteria

1. **Persistence**: Search filter selections persist across search modal close/reopen cycles 100% of the time
2. **Performance**: Filter checkbox response time remains under 50ms for 95th percentile
3. **Reliability**: Fuzzy search produces consistent results with no reported state sync issues
4. **Debugging**: All filter state changes visible in debugging tools with complete action history
5. **No Regression**: All existing search functionality works identically (100% backward compatibility)
6. **State Consistency**: Single source of truth eliminates conflicts between filter panel, search modal, and URL state

---

## Out of Scope

- Redesigning search modal UI or UX
- Changing fuzzy search algorithm or ranking
- Adding new filter types or categories
- Implementing filter presets or saved searches
- Server-side filter persistence (e.g., saving to user preferences)
- Mobile-specific search optimizations
- Search analytics or tracking

## Dependencies and Assumptions

**Dependencies**:
- Existing centralized state management system must support the required filter state structure
- URL synchronization mechanism must be in place for filter state
- Current product filtering system must read from centralized state

**Assumptions**:
- Users expect filter selections to persist within a single session
- Developers need visibility into filter state for debugging
- Current search modal UX is satisfactory and should not change
- Performance requirements (< 50ms response) are achievable with centralized state management
