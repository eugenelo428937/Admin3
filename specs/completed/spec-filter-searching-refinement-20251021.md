## Context: What Changed from Original Spec

### Original Vision (spec-2025-10-20-000000.md)
The original spec described migrating SearchBox filter selections from local React state to Redux state management. The intent was to:
- Persist filter selections across modal open/close cycles
- Enable filter selection within the search modal
- Make filter state visible in Redux DevTools
- Provide "suggested filters" based on search results

### Actual Implementation (2025-10-21)
During development, the implementation evolved to **completely remove filter selection from the search modal**. The current system provides:
- **Search-only modal**: Users type search queries, view top 3 results
- **No filter UI in modal**: No filter chips, no filter selection, no suggested filters
- **Simplified navigation**: "Show All Results" navigates to `/products` page
- **Filter management via FilterPanel**: All filtering done on products page, not in search modal

### Why the Change?
1. **Clearer UX**: Search is for finding, filtering is for refining
2. **Reduced complexity**: No need to manage filter state in two places (modal + products page)
3. **Focused purpose**: Search modal's job is to search, not filter
4. **Existing solution**: FilterPanel on products page already provides comprehensive filtering

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
**As a user**, I want to search for products by typing keywords, so that I can quickly find what I'm looking for without navigating through the entire catalog.

**As a developer**, I want search state (query text) managed in Redux, so that search behavior is consistent and debuggable.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the user opens the search modal (Ctrl+K or navbar icon), **When** the modal opens, **Then** the search input is auto-focused and empty (no default/popular filters shown).

2. **Given** the user types a search query "mock", **When** the search executes (after 300ms debounce), **Then** the top 3 matching products are displayed below the search box.

3. **Given** the user has viewed search results, **When** the user clicks "Show All Matching Products" or presses Enter, **Then** the user is navigated to `/products` page with search query persisted in Redux.

4. **Given** the user closes and reopens the search modal, **When** the modal reopens, **Then** the previous search query is still present in the input field (persisted in Redux).

5. **Given** the user wants to filter products by subject or type, **When** the user navigates to the products page, **Then** the FilterPanel on the left provides comprehensive filtering options (filtering NOT in search modal).

6. **Given** a developer is debugging search behavior, **When** the user types in the search box, **Then** all search query changes are visible in Redux DevTools as `filters/setSearchQuery` actions.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user enters a search query with no matches? (Display "No results found" message with helpful text)
- How does the system handle very short search queries (< 2 characters)? (Returns default empty results, shows no products)
- What happens if search API fails? (Display error Alert, provide fallback empty results structure)

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Search Query Management**:
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain the search query text in Redux state when the search modal is closed and reopened
- **FR-002**: System MUST debounce search input changes by 300ms to avoid excessive API calls
- **FR-003**: System MUST display top 3 matching products in the search modal results area
- **FR-004**: System MUST show loading indicator while search is in progress

**Search Modal Interaction**:
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to navigate to products page via "Show All Matching Products" button
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to navigate to products page by pressing Enter in search input
- **FR-007**: Search modal MUST close when user clicks "Show All Results" and navigate to `/products`
- **FR-008**: Search modal MUST close when user presses Escape key

**Search Results Display**:
- **FR-009**: System MUST display "No results found" message when search query returns zero products
- **FR-010**: System MUST display helpful message when user has not entered a search query (no default results shown)
- **FR-011**: System MUST show total result count: "X of Y results" where X = displayed, Y = total matches
- **FR-012**: System MUST NOT display any filter UI in the search modal (no filter chips, no suggested filters)

**State Persistence**:
- **FR-013**: System MUST persist search query in Redux across search modal open/close cycles
- **FR-014**: System MUST persist search query in Redux when navigating to products page
- **FR-015**: System MUST clear search results when modal is closed (local UI state only)

**Developer Experience**:
- **FR-016**: System MUST make search query changes visible in Redux DevTools
- **FR-017**: System MUST log search query actions as `filters/setSearchQuery` in Redux action history
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide error handling with fallback results structure on API failure

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- **NFR-001**: Search input response time MUST be < 50ms (Redux dispatch is synchronous)
- **NFR-002**: Search modal render time MUST not exceed 100ms
- **NFR-003**: Search API debounce MUST be 300ms (balance between responsiveness and API load)
- **NFR-004**: Theme styling access MUST use defensive optional chaining (`theme.liftkit?.spacing?.lg`) to prevent test failures

### Key Entities

- **Search Query State**: Represents the current search text input stored in Redux (`filters.searchQuery`). This state persists across modal open/close and navigation.

- **Search Results (UI State)**: Represents the fuzzy search API response stored in local component state. This state is cleared when modal closes (local UI only, not persisted in Redux).

- **Search Modal Session**: Represents a single user interaction with the search modal. Search query persists across sessions, but search results do not.

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Search Persistence**: Search query text persists across modal close/reopen cycles 100% of the time
2. **Performance**: Search input typing response time < 50ms (Redux dispatch)
3. **Simplicity**: No filter UI in search modal - filtering happens on products page via FilterPanel
4. **Debugging**: Search query changes visible in Redux DevTools with complete action history
5. **No Regression**: Search functionality works identically to previous version (search-only, no filters)
6. **Error Handling**: Search API failures display user-friendly error messages and provide fallback empty results

---

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly Removed (Compared to Original Spec)
- **Filter selection in search modal**: No filter chips, no suggested filters, no filter UI
- **Popular/default filters**: No default products shown when search is empty
- **Search staging area**: Search doesn't pre-populate filter panel (users filter on products page)
- **Filter state persistence in modal**: Only search query persists, not filters

### Not Implemented (Future Enhancements)
- Redesigning search modal UI or UX (modal design unchanged)
- Changing fuzzy search algorithm or ranking
- Adding autocomplete suggestions for search queries
- Implementing search history or saved searches
- Server-side search query persistence (e.g., saving to user preferences)
- Mobile-specific search optimizations
- Search analytics or tracking

---

## Current System Behavior

### Search Modal Workflow

1. **User Opens Search Modal**
   - Press `Ctrl+K` or click search icon in navbar
   - Modal opens with auto-focused search input
   - No default products shown, no popular filters

2. **User Types Search Query**
   - Type text into search box (e.g., "mock", "tutorial", "pack")
   - 300ms debounce delay before search executes
   - Loading spinner appears during search
   - `filters/setSearchQuery` action dispatched to Redux

3. **Search Results Displayed**
   - Top 3 matching products shown in modal
   - Result count: "3 of 15 results matching 'mock'"
   - "View All Results" button visible
   - "Show All Matching Products" button visible at bottom

4. **User Navigates to Products Page**
   - Click "View All Results" or "Show All Matching Products"
   - OR press Enter in search input
   - Modal closes
   - Navigate to `/products`
   - Search query persisted in Redux (NOT in URL)

5. **User Filters Products on Products Page**
   - FilterPanel on left side provides comprehensive filtering
   - Select subjects, product types, categories, etc.
   - Filters applied to product list
   - Filters visible in URL (via middleware)
   - Search NOT done in modal, filtering NOT done in modal

### Data Flow

```
User Input (search box)
  ‚Üì
Redux Dispatch: setSearchQuery(query)
  ‚Üì
Redux State: filters.searchQuery = "mock"
  ‚Üì
SearchBox: performSearch(query) after 300ms
  ‚Üì
Fuzzy Search API Call
  ‚Üì
Local State: setSearchResults(results)
  ‚Üì
SearchResults: Display top 3 products
  ‚Üì
User Clicks "Show All Results"
  ‚Üì
Navigate: /products (search query in Redux, NOT in URL)
  ‚Üì
Products Page: Uses FilterPanel for filtering
```

### Redux State Shape (Search-Related)

```javascript
{
  filters: {
    // Search query (persisted in Redux)
    searchQuery: "mock",              // Current search text

    // Filter state (NOT managed by search modal)
    subjects: [],                     // Managed by FilterPanel
    categories: [],                   // Managed by FilterPanel
    product_types: [],                // Managed by FilterPanel
    products: [],                     // Managed by FilterPanel
    modes_of_delivery: [],            // Managed by FilterPanel

    // UI state
    currentPage: 1,
    pageSize: 20,
    isFilterPanelOpen: false,
    isLoading: false,
    error: null,
  }
}
```

**Key Point**: Search modal ONLY manages `searchQuery`. All filter fields (`subjects`, `product_types`, etc.) are managed by FilterPanel on the products page, NOT by the search modal.

## Comparison: Original Spec vs. Current Implementation

| Aspect | Original Spec (spec-2025-10-20-000000.md) | Current Implementation |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Filter Selection in Modal** | ‚úÖ Yes - suggested filters, filter chips | ‚ùå No - search only, no filter UI |
| **Search Query Persistence** | ‚úÖ Yes - in Redux | ‚úÖ Yes - in Redux |
| **Filter State Persistence** | ‚úÖ Yes - filters persist across modal cycles | ‚ùå N/A - no filters in modal |
| **Redux Integration** | ‚úÖ Full Redux for filters + search | ‚úÖ Redux for search query only |
| **Navigation with Filters** | ‚úÖ Filters passed to products page | ‚ùå Search query only, no filters |
| **Popular/Default Filters** | ‚úÖ Show default filters on mount | ‚ùå No default filters shown |
| **FilterPanel Integration** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-populate from modal filters | ‚ùå No integration - separate workflows |
| **Search Results Display** | ‚úÖ Top 3 products | ‚úÖ Top 3 products (unchanged) |
| **Redux DevTools Visibility** | ‚úÖ All filter actions visible | ‚úÖ Search query actions visible only |

**Summary**: The current implementation is a **simplified, search-only modal** that removed all filter selection functionality. Filtering is now exclusively done via FilterPanel on the products page.

---

## Rationale for Simplification

### Benefits of Search-Only Modal

1. **Clearer User Intent**:
   - Search modal's purpose is to SEARCH, not filter
   - Filtering is done on products page via FilterPanel (dedicated UI)
   - Users understand: Search ‚Üí Find products, FilterPanel ‚Üí Refine results

2. **Reduced Complexity**:
   - No need to manage filter state in two places (modal + products page)
   - No confusion about where to filter (modal or products page?)
   - Simpler codebase with fewer props and state management

3. **Better Performance**:
   - Fewer Redux actions dispatched in modal (search query only)
   - No need to sync filter state between modal and FilterPanel
   - Faster modal render time (no filter UI components)

4. **Existing Solution**:
   - FilterPanel already provides comprehensive filtering
   - No need to duplicate filtering functionality in modal
   - Users already familiar with FilterPanel workflow

5. **No "Empty Results" Confusion**:
   - Original design showed default/popular filters on mount
   - Users could select filters and see "no matches" on small default dataset
   - Search-only approach eliminates this confusion

### Tradeoffs

| Tradeoff | Impact | Mitigation |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Users can't filter while searching | Minor - users navigate to products page to filter | Clear "Show All Results" button |
| No suggested filters based on search | Minor - users already know what they're searching for | Fuzzy search provides relevant results |
| Search query not sent to products page as filter | Minor - search query stored in Redux but not applied as filter | Users can filter on products page if needed |

**Conclusion**: The benefits of simplification outweigh the tradeoffs. Search-only modal provides clearer UX, simpler codebase, and leverages existing FilterPanel for comprehensive filtering.

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

If future requirements demand filter selection in the search modal, consider:

1. **Minimal Filter UI**: Add subject/category chips below search results
2. **Filter Staging**: Separate `searchFilters` Redux state that syncs to main filters on "Apply"
3. **Suggested Filters**: Show most relevant filters based on search results
4. **Smart Defaults**: Pre-populate filters based on user's search query

These enhancements would require:
- Adding filter UI components to SearchModal
- Creating Redux actions for search filter management
- Syncing search filters to main filters on navigation
- Updating FilterPanel to reflect search selections

**Note**: The current search-only approach should be validated with user feedback before adding filter complexity back into the modal.

---

**Spec Status**: ‚úÖ Completed (Post-Implementation Documentation)
**Implementation Date**: 2025-10-21
**Revision Reason**: Document actual implementation (search-only) vs. original spec (search + filters)
