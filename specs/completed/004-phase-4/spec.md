# Feature Specification: Phase 4 - Cart VAT Integration

**Feature Branch**: `004-phase-4`
**Created**: 2025-01-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "phase 4"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Context: Phase 4 follows successful Phase 3 (composite VAT rules)
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Customers, Cart system, Rules Engine
   ‚Üí Actions: Calculate VAT on cart items, display VAT breakdowns
   ‚Üí Data: Cart items, VAT rates, regional rules
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must use Phase 3 composite rules
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úì RESOLVED: VAT recalculated only when cart modified (add/remove/quantity change)
   ‚Üí ‚úì RESOLVED: VAT-exclusive display (net price prominent, VAT as separate line item)
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should multi-currency carts handle VAT?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User adds items to cart ‚Üí VAT calculated ‚Üí displayed in cart
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable against Phase 3 rule execution
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Cart, CartItem, VAT calculation result

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-12
- Q: When should VAT be recalculated for cart items? ‚Üí A: Recalculate only when cart modified (add/remove/quantity change)
- Q: How should prices be displayed to customers in the cart? ‚Üí A: VAT-exclusive (show net price prominently, VAT as separate line below)
- Q: When should VAT rates be locked for an order? ‚Üí A: Lock VAT rates at order creation with timestamp (VAT can recalculate until order record created)
- Q: How should users be notified when VAT calculation fails? ‚Üí A: Display error message with retry button (show error, provide "Recalculate VAT" button)
- Q: How long should historical VAT data be retained? ‚Üí A: 2 years (standard tax audit period, covers typical tax authority audit window)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a customer shopping on the Online Store for Actuarial Education, I need to see accurate VAT calculations on my cart items so that I understand the total cost before checkout, including the tax I'll be charged based on my country.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a UK customer with an empty cart, **When** they add a Digital product worth ¬£50, **Then** the cart displays:
   - Net amount: ¬£50.00
   - VAT (20%): ¬£10.00
   - Gross total: ¬£60.00

2. **Given** a South African customer with an empty cart, **When** they add a Printed product worth R500, **Then** the cart displays:
   - Net amount: R500.00
   - VAT (15%): R75.00
   - Gross total: R575.00

3. **Given** a customer from an unknown country (ROW), **When** they add any product, **Then** the cart displays:
   - Net amount: [original price]
   - VAT (0%): 0.00
   - Gross total: [original price]

4. **Given** a UK customer with multiple items in cart (Digital ¬£50, Printed ¬£100, FlashCard ¬£30), **When** they view their cart, **Then** the cart displays:
   - Total net amount: ¬£180.00
   - Total VAT (20%): ¬£36.00
   - Total gross amount: ¬£216.00

5. **Given** a customer with items in cart, **When** they change their delivery country, **Then** VAT is recalculated based on the new country's rules

6. **Given** a customer viewing cart, **When** VAT rules are updated by admin, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should cart reflect new rates immediately or only for new sessions?]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a customer's country cannot be determined?
  - **Expected**: System defaults to ROW region with 0% VAT
- How does system handle cart items added before VAT rules exist?
  - **Expected**: System applies current active VAT rules on cart view
- What happens if Phase 3 rules engine fails during cart calculation?
  - **Expected**: Display error message with "Recalculate VAT" button, show net prices only without blocking cart view (per FR-014, FR-017)
- How are partial refunds handled when VAT rates change between purchase and refund?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Refund VAT policy not specified]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Cart VAT Calculation
- **FR-001**: System MUST calculate VAT for each cart item using Phase 3 composite rules at cart_calculate_vat entry point
- **FR-002**: System MUST display individual VAT amounts for each cart item
- **FR-003**: System MUST display total VAT amount across all cart items
- **FR-004**: System MUST display gross totals (net + VAT) for individual items and cart total
- **FR-005**: System MUST recalculate VAT when cart items are added, removed, or quantities changed
- **FR-006**: System MUST recalculate VAT when user's delivery country changes (triggers cart modification)

#### VAT Display and Transparency
- **FR-007**: System MUST clearly label VAT amounts separately from net prices
- **FR-008**: System MUST display the VAT rate percentage applied to each item
- **FR-009**: System MUST show regional VAT information (e.g., "UK VAT 20%" or "SA VAT 15%")
- **FR-010**: System MUST display net prices prominently with VAT shown as separate line item below each product

#### Integration with Checkout
- **FR-011**: System MUST pass VAT calculations to checkout process for order creation
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure VAT amounts at checkout match final cart VAT calculations
- **FR-013**: System MUST lock VAT rates at order creation with timestamp, allowing recalculation throughout cart and checkout until order record is created

#### Error Handling and Fallbacks
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle rules engine failures gracefully without blocking cart view
- **FR-015**: System MUST default to 0% VAT if country cannot be determined or rules are unavailable
- **FR-016**: System MUST log VAT calculation errors for admin review
- **FR-017**: System MUST display error message with "Recalculate VAT" button when VAT calculation fails, allowing user to retry calculation

#### Performance Requirements
- **FR-018**: System MUST calculate VAT for cart items within 50ms per item (Phase 3 target)
- **FR-019**: System MUST support concurrent VAT calculations for multiple users without degradation
- **FR-020**: System MUST cache VAT calculations between cart modifications to optimize performance (recalculate only on add/remove/quantity/country changes)

#### Data Persistence
- **FR-021**: System MUST store VAT amounts with cart items for audit purposes
- **FR-022**: System MUST preserve VAT calculation metadata (region, rate, rule versions used)
- **FR-023**: System MUST retain historical VAT data for 2 years to meet standard tax audit period requirements

#### Multi-Item Cart Scenarios
- **FR-024**: System MUST handle carts with different product types (Digital, Printed, FlashCard, PBOR, Tutorial)
- **FR-025**: System MUST apply correct VAT rules per product type within same cart
- **FR-026**: System MUST aggregate VAT correctly across mixed product types
- **FR-027**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: handle carts with items requiring different VAT treatments - bundled pricing?]

  - References Product and ProductVariation
  - Stores quantity, net price, VAT amount, gross amount
  - Links to VAT calculation result from rules engine
  - Preserves product type for VAT rule matching

- **VAT Calculation Result**: Output from Phase 3 rules engine
  - Contains region, VAT rate, VAT amount, gross amount
  - References rule codes executed (master, regional, product)
  - Includes execution time and success status
  - Stored with cart item for audit trail
