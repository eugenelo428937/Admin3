# Implementation Plan: Performance Monitoring & Integration Testing Infrastructure

**Branch**: `008-docs-stories-story` | **Date**: 2025-10-25 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/work/Documents/Code/Admin3/specs/008-docs-stories-story/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

This plan implements two complementary infrastructure features for the refactored filtering system:

**Story 1.15 - Performance Monitoring**: Adds comprehensive performance tracking for filter operations using Browser Performance API and Redux middleware, with configurable performance budgets and development-only overhead.

**Story 1.16 - Integration Testing**: Creates a complete integration test suite using React Testing Library and MSW (Mock Service Worker) to verify Redux middleware integration, component collaboration, and backward compatibility with 90%+ coverage target and <30 second execution time.

Both stories enhance developer experience and code quality without affecting production bundle size or runtime performance.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES2020+, React 18.3.1, Node.js 18+
**Primary Dependencies**:
- Redux Toolkit 2.2.7 (state management)
- React Testing Library 14.0.0 (component testing)
- Jest 27.5.1 (test runner)
- MSW 2.x (API mocking)
- Browser Performance API (native)

**Storage**: Browser localStorage (filter persistence), URL query parameters (shareable state)
**Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + MSW for integration tests
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
**Project Type**: Web (frontend React application + Django REST backend)

**Performance Goals**:
- Redux operations: <16ms (60 FPS threshold)
- URL synchronization: <5ms
- API calls: <1000ms
- Filter validation: <10ms
- Registry lookups: <1ms

**Constraints**:
- Zero production overhead (performance monitoring dev-only)
- Tree-shaking for production builds
- <30 second test suite execution
- 90%+ integration test coverage
- Backward compatibility with Story 1.14 refactoring

**Scale/Scope**:
- ~15 filter types across subjects, categories, products, modes
- ~500 lines of performance monitoring code
- ~1500 lines of integration tests
- 10+ integration test scenarios per story

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
- ✅ PASS - Story 1.15: Performance monitoring tests written before implementation
- ✅ PASS - Story 1.16: Integration tests ARE the implementation (test infrastructure story)
- ✅ PASS - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle enforced for all new code

**Integration Testing**:
- ✅ PASS - Story 1.16 creates comprehensive integration test suite
- ✅ PASS - Tests verify Redux middleware chain integration
- ✅ PASS - Tests verify component collaboration
- ✅ PASS - Tests verify backward compatibility

**Observability**:
- ✅ PASS - Story 1.15 adds comprehensive performance monitoring
- ✅ PASS - Console logging for development visibility
- ✅ PASS - Redux DevTools integration for state debugging

**Zero Production Overhead**:
- ✅ PASS - Performance monitoring tree-shaken in production
- ✅ PASS - All monitoring code behind process.env.NODE_ENV guards
- ✅ PASS - No runtime overhead in production builds

**Simplicity**:
- ✅ PASS - Using standard Browser Performance API (no custom libraries)
- ✅ PASS - Using MSW for API mocking (industry standard)
- ✅ PASS - Minimal abstraction - direct instrumentation where needed

**No Constitution Violations** - All principles satisfied

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

**Story 1.15 - Performance Monitoring** (15 tasks estimated):
1. **Contract Tests** (TDD RED phase):
   - PerformanceTracker contract test [P]
   - Performance monitoring middleware contract test [P]
   - Performance budgets config test [P]

2. **Implementation** (TDD GREEN phase):
   - Create PerformanceTracker utility class
   - Create performance budgets configuration
   - Create performance monitoring middleware
   - Add instrumentation to urlSyncMiddleware
   - Add instrumentation to FilterValidator
   - Add instrumentation to FilterRegistry
   - Add instrumentation to useProductsSearch hook

3. **Integration**:
   - Wire performance middleware into Redux store
   - Configure Redux DevTools integration
   - Add console reporting

4. **Verification**:
   - Verify zero production overhead (tree-shaking test)
   - Verify all performance budgets met
   - Run quickstart validation

**Story 1.16 - Integration Testing** (20 tasks estimated):
1. **Test Infrastructure** (these ARE the tests):
   - Create test utilities module (renderWithProviders, createMockStore, etc.) [P]
   - Create mock data module [P]
   - Create MSW handlers [P]
   - Configure setupTests.js for MSW

2. **Integration Test Suites** (TDD - tests ARE implementation):
   - Redux middleware integration tests [P]
   - Filter persistence tests [P]
   - FilterRegistry integration tests [P]
   - FilterValidator integration tests [P]
   - FilterPanel component integration tests [P]
   - ActiveFilters component integration tests [P]
   - ProductList component integration tests [P]
   - useProductsSearch hook integration tests [P]
   - Backward compatibility tests [P]

3. **Verification**:
   - Run full test suite, verify <30s execution
   - Check coverage, verify >90%
   - Run flaky test detection
   - Run quickstart validation

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Story 1.15 first** (performance monitoring infrastructure)
- **Story 1.16 second** (uses performance monitoring for test execution metrics)
- Within each story: TDD order (tests before implementation)
- Mark [P] for tasks that can run in parallel (independent files)

**Dependencies**:
- Story 1.16 depends on Story 1.15 for test execution performance metrics (optional)
- Both stories depend on Story 1.14 (filters refactoring complete)

**Estimated Output**: ~35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
