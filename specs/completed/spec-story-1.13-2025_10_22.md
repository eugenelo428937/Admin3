## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer maintaining the product filtering system, I need to remove the redundant cookie-based filter persistence mechanism in favor of URL-based persistence so that the codebase is simpler, filters are more reliably shareable via URLs, and there are no synchronization issues between two persistence mechanisms.

### User Story (End User Perspective)
As a user of the product catalog, I need my filter selections to persist when I refresh the page or share URLs with colleagues so that I can easily return to specific product views and share filtered results with others.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** URL-based filter persistence is working, **When** cookie persistence middleware is removed, **Then** users should still be able to refresh pages and see their filters restored from the URL

2. **Given** a user applies filters to the product list, **When** the page URL updates with filter parameters, **Then** no filter data should be stored in browser cookies

3. **Given** a user shares a URL with applied filters, **When** another user opens that URL, **Then** the recipient should see the same filtered results without requiring cookies

4. **Given** legacy filter cookies exist in a user's browser, **When** the application initializes, **Then** the system should optionally clear old filter cookies to prevent confusion

5. **Given** the cookie middleware has been removed, **When** checking browser storage, **Then** no filter-related cookies should be present

### Edge Cases
- What happens to users who have existing filter cookies when middleware is removed?
  - Optional cleanup on app init clears legacy cookies; otherwise they're ignored
- How does system handle filter persistence if URL is manually cleared?
  - Filters return to default state (same as current behavior)
- What if URL-based persistence fails for some reason?
  - Users can re-apply filters; no worse than current state
- How are bookmarks affected by this change?
  - Bookmarks continue to work identically (URL-based); cookies were never shareable anyway

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST remove cookie persistence middleware from application state management
- **FR-002**: System MUST remove all imports and references to cookie persistence functionality
- **FR-003**: System MUST delete cookie persistence middleware file(s) from codebase
- **FR-004**: System MUST remove any cookie-related actions from filter state management
- **FR-005**: Filter persistence MUST continue to work via URL parameters after cookie removal
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to refresh pages and have filters restored from URL
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to share filter URLs and have recipients see identical filter selections
- **FR-008**: System MUST NOT create filter-related cookies after middleware removal
- **FR-009**: System SHOULD optionally clear legacy filter cookies on application initialization
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain identical filter functionality with or without cookie middleware
- **FR-011**: Browser cookie storage MUST NOT contain filter-related data after middleware removal
- **FR-012**: Code complexity MUST be reduced by eliminating redundant persistence mechanism

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Code must be simpler and easier to maintain after cookie middleware removal
- **NFR-002**: No visible changes to user experience (filters persist identically via URL)
- **NFR-003**: No performance degradation (potentially faster due to one less middleware)
- **NFR-004**: No console errors or warnings after middleware removal

### Key Entities

- **URL Persistence**: Primary mechanism for filter state persistence (already implemented)
  - Mechanism: URL query parameters updated by middleware
  - Restoration: URL parsed on page load to restore filter state
  - Sharing: URLs can be bookmarked and shared

- **Cookie Persistence (Removed)**: Redundant persistence mechanism to be eliminated
  - Previous function: Stored filter state in browser cookies
  - Problem: Redundant with URL persistence, not shareable, creates sync issues
  - Action: Complete removal from codebase

- **Filter State**: Application state representing active filters
  - Storage: Redux state management
  - Persistence: URL parameters only (after this change)
  - Restoration: URL parsing on page load

## Success Criteria

1. **Code Simplification**: 100-200 lines of cookie middleware code removed
2. **No Functional Regression**: Filter persistence works identically via URL
3. **Clean Browser Storage**: No filter-related cookies in browser storage
4. **Improved Shareability**: URL remains primary shareable mechanism (no change, but clarified)
5. **No Console Errors**: Application initializes without errors after middleware removal
6. **Maintainability**: Simpler middleware chain, easier to understand
7. **Performance**: Same or better performance (one less middleware to execute)

---

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Story 1.1 (URL Sync Middleware) provides URL-based persistence
- Story 1.6 (ProductList URL parsing) provides URL-based restoration

### Assumptions
- URL-based persistence is fully functional and tested
- Cookie middleware was only used for filter persistence (no other features depend on it)
- Users do not rely on cookie-based persistence (URL bookmarks are preferred method)
- Legacy cookies can be safely cleared or ignored without user impact

---

## Out of Scope

- Changing URL-based persistence mechanism
- Adding new persistence mechanisms (e.g., localStorage)
- User preference storage for non-filter data
- Session management or authentication cookies
- Analytics or tracking cookies

---

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Users Lose Saved Filter Preferences
**Impact**: Low
**Probability**: Very Low
**Mitigation**: URL-based persistence is superior to cookies (shareable, bookmarkable); users who bookmarked URLs retain filters; cookies were never a reliable long-term storage mechanism

### Risk 2: Cookie Middleware Used for Non-Filter Data
**Impact**: High (breaks other features)
**Probability**: Very Low
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive code search confirms cookie middleware only used for filters; manual review of middleware purpose before deletion

### Risk 3: Breaking Change Introduced Unintentionally
**Impact**: Medium
**Probability**: Low
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing of all filter functionality; verification that no other features depend on cookie middleware; rollback plan ready

---

## Before/After Comparison

### Current State (Before)
- **Persistence mechanisms**: URL parameters + Browser cookies (redundant)
- **Shareability**: URLs shareable, cookies not shareable
- **Complexity**: Two middleware components for persistence
- **Sync issues**: URL and cookie state can diverge
- **Code size**: ~200 lines for two persistence mechanisms

### Future State (After)
- **Persistence mechanism**: URL parameters only (single source of truth)
- **Shareability**: URLs shareable (unchanged)
- **Complexity**: One middleware component for persistence
- **Sync issues**: Eliminated (single mechanism)
- **Code size**: ~100 lines (cookie middleware removed)

---

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Verification
- Verify URL persistence is working correctly
- Verify all filter types persist via URL
- Document any features that use cookie middleware

### Phase 2: Removal
- Remove cookie middleware from application configuration
- Delete cookie middleware file(s)
- Remove cookie-related actions from state management
- Search and remove all cookie middleware imports

### Phase 3: Cleanup (Optional)
- Add one-time legacy cookie cleanup on app init
- Clear old filter cookies from user browsers
- Log cleanup action for monitoring

### Phase 4: Testing
- Test all filter functionality works via URL
- Verify no filter cookies are created
- Test page refresh restores filters from URL
- Test URL sharing works correctly
- Verify no console errors

### Phase 5: Documentation
- Update architecture docs to reflect URL-only persistence
- Remove cookie persistence from developer guides
- Update deployment/release notes

---

## Privacy and Security Considerations

### Privacy Benefits
- **Reduced cookie usage**: Eliminates filter cookies entirely
- **User control**: Users control persistence via URL management (bookmarks, history)
- **No tracking**: Filter state not stored in cookies that could be used for tracking
- **Transparency**: Filter state visible in URL (users can see what's being persisted)

### Security Considerations
- **No change to security posture**: Removing non-sensitive filter cookies doesn't affect security
- **Reduced attack surface**: Fewer cookies means less data that could be manipulated
- **URL-based state**: No new security concerns (URL parameters already validated)

---

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (5 minutes)
If filter persistence breaks after cookie removal:
1. Revert commits that removed cookie middleware
2. Cookie middleware restored to application
3. Both URL and cookie persistence active again
4. Investigate root cause of URL persistence failure

### Fix Forward (1 hour)
If issue identified with URL persistence:
1. Keep cookie middleware removed
2. Fix URL persistence mechanism
3. Re-verify all filter scenarios
4. Re-deploy without cookie middleware
