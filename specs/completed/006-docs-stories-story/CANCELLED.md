# ‚ùå FEATURE CANCELLED/REMOVED

## Summary

This specification directory (`006-docs-stories-story`) was created for Stories 1.7-1.8 to implement navbar filters in the FilterPanel and ActiveFilters components. The features were **implemented and then removed** as they were determined to be unnecessary.

## Removal Details

- **Removal Date**: 2025-10-20
- **Removal Commit**: `026f2f23` - `refactor(filters): Remove navbar filters from FilterPanel, ActiveFilters, and Redux store`
- **Related Stories**:
  - Story 1.7: Display Navbar Filters in FilterPanel (CANCELLED)
  - Story 1.8: Display Navbar Filters in ActiveFilters (CANCELLED)

## What Was Removed

The following navbar filters were removed from the codebase:
- `tutorial_format` - Tutorial format selection (Online/In-Person/Hybrid)
- `distance_learning` - Distance learning only filter (boolean)
- `tutorial` - Tutorial products only filter (boolean)

## Files Removed/Modified

### Code Removed (746 lines total):
1. **Redux Store** (`filtersSlice.js`):
   - State fields, actions, selectors for navbar filters
2. **FilterPanel Component** (`FilterPanel.js`):
   - 3 accordion sections for navbar filters
3. **ActiveFilters Component** (`ActiveFilters.js`):
   - FILTER_CONFIG entries and chip rendering for navbar filters
4. **Tests**:
   - `FilterPanel.test.js`: 9 tests removed
   - `ActiveFilters.test.js`: 7 tests removed
   - `filtersSlice.navbar.integration.test.js`: Entire file deleted (151 lines)

### Documentation Updated:
- `CLAUDE.md`: Removed navbar filter references from Redux state documentation
- `docs/stories/story-1.7-display-navbar-filters-filterpanel.md`: Marked as CANCELLED
- `docs/stories/story-1.8-display-navbar-filters-activefilters.md`: Marked as CANCELLED

## Reason for Removal

The navbar filter features were determined to be unnecessary after implementation review. The requirements changed and these filters were no longer needed for the product filtering functionality.

## Specification Files Status

The files in this directory remain for **historical reference only**:
- `plan.md` - Original implementation plan
- `research.md` - Technology research and decisions
- `data-model.md` - Data model (no changes needed as no new entities)
- `quickstart.md` - Test scenarios that were implemented then removed
- `tasks.md` - Implementation tasks that were completed then removed
- `spec.md` - Full specification document
- `contracts/README.md` - API contracts (no changes as existing endpoint used)

## Notes

- This specification represents work that was completed according to TDD methodology
- All tests were written first (RED phase), implementation completed (GREEN phase), then the entire feature was removed
- The removal was clean with no orphaned code or references remaining
- This serves as a historical record of the decision-making process
