## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user searching for products, I need the system to prevent me from selecting incompatible filter combinations before making a search so that I don't waste time viewing empty results and understand why certain combinations don't work.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I select a tutorial format (e.g., "Online") without selecting "Tutorial Products", **When** validation runs, **Then** I should see a clear error message explaining that tutorial format requires the Tutorial Products filter to be selected

2. **Given** I select "Distance Learning" and then select "In-Person" tutorial format, **When** validation runs, **Then** I should see an error explaining that distance learning is not available for in-person tutorials, with a suggestion to select Online or Hybrid instead

3. **Given** I have active validation errors, **When** I attempt to search or load products, **Then** the system should prevent the API call and display a message asking me to fix validation errors

4. **Given** I have validation errors displayed, **When** I correct the filter combination to be valid, **Then** the error messages should automatically disappear

5. **Given** I apply filters that trigger multiple validation rules, **When** errors are displayed, **Then** error-severity issues should appear before warning-severity issues

### Edge Cases
- What happens when validation rules conflict with each other?
  - System should prioritize by severity and display most critical errors first
- How does system handle rapidly changing filters (user clicking multiple filters quickly)?
  - System should validate after each change, but only most recent validation results are displayed
- What if validation takes too long (performance issue)?
  - Validation must execute in < 5ms to provide real-time feedback
- How are validation errors cleared?
  - Errors automatically cleared when filters change to valid state; user can also dismiss individually

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST validate filter combinations before allowing product search API calls
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that tutorial_format filter requires tutorial=true
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that distance_learning=true is incompatible with tutorial_format='in_person'
- **FR-004**: System MUST support validation rule: products must belong to selected product groups (if backend provides mapping)
- **FR-005**: Validation errors MUST include: field identifier, human-readable message, severity level (error/warning), actionable suggestion
- **FR-006**: System MUST support error severity levels: "error" (blocks action) and "warning" (advises but allows action)
- **FR-007**: System MUST display validation errors prominently in the filter interface
- **FR-008**: System MUST group displayed errors by severity (errors first, then warnings)
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to dismiss individual validation messages
- **FR-010**: System MUST automatically re-validate and update error display after any filter change
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent product search API calls when error-severity validation issues exist
- **FR-012**: System MUST show user-friendly message when API call is blocked due to validation
- **FR-013**: Validation logic MUST execute in under 5ms to support real-time feedback
- **FR-014**: System MUST persist validation state in application state for UI rendering
- **FR-015**: Validation rules MUST be extensible to support future filter types and business rules

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Validation error messages must be clear, non-technical, and actionable
- **NFR-002**: Validation must not introduce noticeable UI lag (< 5ms execution time)
- **NFR-003**: Validation errors must be visually distinct from other UI messages
- **NFR-004**: Validation system must support future localization (i18n)

### Key Entities

- **FilterValidator**: Validation logic processor that evaluates filter state against business rules
  - Operations: validate, hasErrors, getErrors, getWarnings
  - Rules: validateTutorialFormat, validateDistanceLearning, validateProductGroups

- **ValidationError**: Structured error information
  - Properties: field (which filter), message (explanation), severity (error/warning), suggestion (how to fix)

- **Validation State**: Application state storing current validation results
  - Properties: validationErrors array, hasValidationErrors boolean
  - Lifecycle: Updated after every filter change, cleared when filters become valid

- **Validation Rules**: Business logic defining valid/invalid filter combinations
  - Rule 1: Tutorial format requires tutorial products
  - Rule 2: Distance learning incompatible with in-person format
  - Rule 3: Products must match selected product groups
  - Extensible: New rules can be added for future requirements

## Success Criteria

1. **User Guidance**: Users receive clear, actionable error messages for invalid filter combinations
2. **Wasted Effort Reduction**: Invalid API calls eliminated (zero empty result pages from validation-preventable issues)
3. **Performance**: Validation executes in < 5ms (imperceptible to users)
4. **Error Prevention**: Error-severity validation blocks API calls; warning-severity advises but allows
5. **Automatic Feedback**: Validation runs and updates display automatically on every filter change
6. **Test Coverage**: Validation logic achieves ‚â•90% code coverage
7. **User Experience**: Clear visual distinction between validation errors and other messages

---

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Story 1.11 (Filter Registry) provides filter metadata for validation rules

### Assumptions
- Current validation rules (tutorial format, distance learning) represent most common invalid combinations
- Backend API does not currently validate filter combinations (frontend must prevent invalid requests)
- Users prefer immediate feedback over allowing invalid searches and showing empty results
- Product-to-group mapping may not be available initially (validation rule can be added later)

---

## Out of Scope

- Server-side validation (this is client-side validation only)
- Validation rules for data integrity (e.g., preventing XSS in search queries)
- Complex validation rules requiring backend data (e.g., checking product availability)
- Validation rule configuration UI for administrators
- A/B testing different validation strategies
- Analytics tracking of validation error frequency

---

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Overly Strict Validation Blocks Valid Use Cases
**Impact**: High (frustrates users)
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Conservative validation rules (only block truly invalid combinations); user testing to verify rules make sense; support warning severity for uncertain cases

### Risk 2: Performance Impact on Filter Changes
**Impact**: Medium (sluggish UI)
**Probability**: Low
**Mitigation**: Fast validation logic (< 5ms target); debounce validation if needed; performance profiling and optimization

### Risk 3: Validation Rules Out of Sync with Backend
**Impact**: High (users blocked from valid searches)
**Probability**: Low
**Mitigation**: Coordinate validation rules with backend team; document validation rules clearly; monitor validation error rates in production

---

## Validation Rules Detail

### Rule 1: Tutorial Format Requires Tutorial Products
**Trigger**: user selects tutorial_format without tutorial=true
**Error**: "Tutorial format filter requires selecting 'Tutorial Products'"
**Suggestion**: "Please check the 'Tutorial Products' filter"
**Severity**: error (blocks API call)
**Rationale**: Tutorial format is meaningless without tutorial products filter

### Rule 2: Distance Learning Incompatible with In-Person
**Trigger**: user selects distance_learning=true AND tutorial_format='in_person'
**Error**: "Distance learning is not available for in-person tutorials"
**Suggestion**: "Please select 'Online' or 'Hybrid' tutorial format, or disable distance learning"
**Severity**: error (blocks API call)
**Rationale**: Distance learning and in-person are mutually exclusive concepts

### Rule 3: Products Must Match Product Groups (Future)
**Trigger**: user selects products that don't belong to selected product_types
**Error**: "Product 'X' is not available in product group 'Y'"
**Suggestion**: "Please adjust your product or product group selection"
**Severity**: warning (advises but allows)
**Rationale**: May be valid use case with current backend logic; don't block unnecessarily

## User Experience Flow

### Invalid Filter Selection
1. User navigates to product filter page
2. User selects "Online" from tutorial format dropdown
3. System validates: detects tutorial_format without tutorial=true
4. System displays error alert: "Tutorial format filter requires selecting 'Tutorial Products'"
5. User cannot proceed with search (API call blocked)
6. User checks "Tutorial Products" checkbox
7. System re-validates: no errors
8. Error alert automatically disappears
9. User can now search with valid filters

### Multiple Validation Errors
1. User selects distance_learning=true
2. User selects tutorial_format='in_person'
3. System validates: detects incompatibility
4. System displays error alert
5. User also selects tutorial_format='online' (without tutorial=true)
6. System validates: detects two errors (tutorial_format requires tutorial, distance_learning was incompatible with old selection)
7. System displays both errors, severity-sorted
8. User corrects filters
9. Errors clear automatically as corrections are made
