## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **finance administrator**, I need the Rules Engine to automatically calculate correct VAT amounts for cart items based on the customer's region and the product type being purchased, so that customers see accurate pricing and the company complies with international VAT regulations without requiring code deployments for VAT rate changes.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: UK Customer Purchases Digital Product
**Given** a customer from UK (country code 'GB') with a cart containing 1 digital product (Flashcards PDF) priced at ¬£50.00 net
**When** the Rules Engine executes the VAT calculation at checkout
**Then** the system MUST:
- Identify region as 'UK' via master rule
- Delegate to `calculate_vat_uk` regional rule
- Delegate to `calculate_vat_uk_digital_product` product rule
- Calculate VAT at 20% standard rate: ¬£50.00 √ó 0.20 = ¬£10.00
- Return cart item with `vat_amount: 10.00, gross_amount: 60.00`

#### Scenario 2: South Africa Customer Purchases Printed Material
**Given** a customer from South Africa (country code 'ZA') with a cart containing 1 printed study manual priced at R500.00 net
**When** the Rules Engine executes the VAT calculation at checkout
**Then** the system MUST:
- Identify region as 'SA' via master rule
- Delegate to `calculate_vat_sa` regional rule
- Delegate to `calculate_vat_sa_product` product rule
- Calculate VAT at 15% standard rate: R500.00 √ó 0.15 = R75.00
- Return cart item with `vat_amount: 75.00, gross_amount: 575.00`

#### Scenario 3: EU Customer Purchases Tutorial (Service)
**Given** a customer from France (country code 'FR') with a cart containing 1 online tutorial priced at ‚Ç¨100.00 net
**When** the Rules Engine executes the VAT calculation at checkout
**Then** the system MUST:
- Identify region as 'EU' via master rule
- Delegate to `calculate_vat_eu` regional rule
- Delegate to `calculate_vat_eu_product` product rule
- Apply EU digital services VAT rate (varies by country)
- Return cart item with correct VAT amount and gross amount

#### Scenario 4: UK Customer Purchases Multiple Product Types
**Given** a customer from UK with cart containing:
- 1 printed study manual (¬£100.00 net)
- 1 digital flashcard set (¬£30.00 net)
- 1 online tutorial (¬£200.00 net)

**When** the Rules Engine executes VAT calculation
**Then** the system MUST:
- Process each cart item independently through rule hierarchy
- Apply correct product-specific rules for each item type
- Calculate individual VAT amounts with proper rounding
- Return cart with all items having correct `vat_amount` and `gross_amount`

#### Scenario 5: Ireland Customer Purchases PBOR Product
**Given** a customer from Ireland (country code 'IE') with a cart containing 1 Printed By On Request (PBOR) product priced at ‚Ç¨80.00 net
**When** the Rules Engine executes VAT calculation
**Then** the system MUST:
- Identify region as 'IE' via master rule
- Delegate to `calculate_vat_ie` regional rule
- Delegate to `calculate_vat_ie_product` product rule
- Apply Ireland VAT rate (23% standard rate)
- Calculate VAT: ‚Ç¨80.00 √ó 0.23 = ‚Ç¨18.40
- Return cart item with `vat_amount: 18.40, gross_amount: 98.40`

### Edge Cases

#### Edge Case 1: Unknown Region Falls Back to ROW
**What happens when** a customer from an unmapped country (e.g., 'XX') attempts checkout?
**Expected behavior**: Master rule delegates to `calculate_vat_row` (Rest of World) regional rule, which applies zero VAT rate as safe default.

#### Edge Case 2: Product Type Not Matched by Specific Rule
**What happens when** a new product type is added that doesn't have a specific product rule?
**Expected behavior**: Regional rule applies default VAT calculation using standard region rate, no crash or error.

#### Edge Case 3: Zero Net Amount Cart Item
**What happens when** a cart item has net_amount of 0.00 (e.g., free promotional item)?
**Expected behavior**: VAT calculation returns 0.00 VAT amount, gross amount remains 0.00, no division by zero errors.

#### Edge Case 4: Extremely High-Value Transaction
**What happens when** a cart item has net_amount of ¬£999,999.99?
**Expected behavior**: VAT calculation maintains Decimal precision, rounds to 2 decimal places correctly (no floating point errors).

#### Edge Case 5: Database Contains Inactive Country
**What happens when** cart references a country code that exists in database but has `active=False`?
**Expected behavior**: Phase 2 `lookup_vat_rate()` returns 0.00 default, rule execution continues without error.

### Key Entities *(includes data structures)*

#### Rule Hierarchy Structure
- **Master Rule**: Single entry point that delegates based on region (Priority 100)
  - Calls `lookup_region()` Phase 2 function
  - Delegates to regional rules
  - Stores region in context for downstream rules

- **Regional Rules**: Five region-specific rules (Priority 90)
  - UK: `calculate_vat_uk`
  - Ireland: `calculate_vat_ie`
  - EU: `calculate_vat_eu`
  - South Africa: `calculate_vat_sa`
  - Rest of World: `calculate_vat_row`
  - Each calls `lookup_vat_rate()` Phase 2 function
  - Each delegates to product-specific rules or applies default

- **Product-Specific Rules**: Eleven product rules (Priority 80-95)
  - UK Digital Product (Priority 95)
  - UK Printed Product (Priority 85)
  - UK Flash Card (Priority 80)
  - UK PBOR (Priority 80)
  - EU Product (Priority 85)
  - SA Product (Priority 85)
  - IE Product (Priority 85)
  - ROW Product (Priority 85)
  - Each calls `calculate_vat_amount()` Phase 2 function
  - Each returns updated cart item with VAT amounts

#### Context Data Structure
Context passed through rule chain includes:
- **Cart Item**: Product ID, product type, net amount, currency
- **User**: User ID, country code, region (after lookup)
- **VAT Data**: VAT rate (after lookup), VAT amount (after calculation)
- **Audit**: Timestamps, rule execution IDs

#### Rule JSON Structure
Each rule stored in `ActedRule` model with JSONB fields:
- **rule_id**: Unique identifier (e.g., "calculate_vat_uk_digital_product")
- **name**: Human-readable name
- **entry_point**: Execution trigger point (e.g., "cart_calculate_vat")
- **priority**: Execution order (100 for master, 90 for regional, 80-95 for product)
- **condition**: JSONLogic expression for rule matching
- **actions**: Array of actions to execute (call_function, update_context)
- **version**: Rule version number for audit trail
