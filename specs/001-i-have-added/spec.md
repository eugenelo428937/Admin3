# Feature Specification: Implement Recommended Product Function for Marking Product Card

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-have-added`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I have added more entries to the acted_product_productvariation_recommendations table, we will need to implement the recommended product function to the Marking product card."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: Extend product recommendation functionality to Marking Product Card
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users browsing marking products
   ‚Üí Actions: View recommendations, purchase marking products with recommendations
   ‚Üí Data: ProductVariationRecommendation table entries (acted_product_productvariation_recommendations)
   ‚Üí Constraints: Only marking products, must integrate with existing recommendation system
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the recommendation UI match MaterialProductCard's SpeedDial implementation?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens when a marking product has all deadlines expired but has recommendations?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should recommendations be filtered based on deadline availability?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚úì User scenarios defined based on existing MaterialProductCard patterns
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚úì Requirements testable and aligned with existing architecture
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚úì ProductVariationRecommendation, MarkingProductCard
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚ö† WARN "Spec has uncertainties - 3 clarification items marked"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user browsing the online store views a marking product (e.g., "CB1 Mock Exam Marking Service"). The system recommends a complementary product (e.g., "CB1 Mock Exam eBook") based on pre-configured business rules stored in the database. The user can:
1. Purchase the marking product alone
2. Purchase the marking product with the recommended product in one action
3. View pricing details for both products before purchasing

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user views a marking product with a recommended product configured in the database, **When** they see the product card, **Then** they should see a purchase option that includes the recommended product alongside the standard "Add to Cart" button.

2. **Given** a marking product has no recommended product configured, **When** a user views the product card, **Then** they should only see the standard "Add to Cart" button without recommendation options.

3. **Given** a user selects the "Buy with Recommended" option, **When** they confirm the purchase, **Then** both the marking product AND the recommended product should be added to their shopping cart in a single action.

4. **Given** a marking product has a recommended product, **When** the user hovers over or interacts with the recommendation option, **Then** they should see clear pricing information for both the marking product and the recommended product.

5. **Given** a marking product has expired deadlines and a recommended product, **When** the user views the product, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the recommendation still be shown? Should it be disabled? Should there be a different message?]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a recommended product has no valid price for the user's region?
- How does the system handle recommendations when the recommended product itself has variations?
- What happens if the recommended product is already in the user's cart?
- How should the UI behave when both marking deadlines AND recommendations need to be displayed?
- What happens when a marking product has discount pricing (retaker/additional copy) and a recommendation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a recommendation purchase option on marking product cards when a recommendation relationship exists in the acted_product_productvariation_recommendations table for that product-variation combination
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to purchase both the marking product AND its recommended product in a single action
- **FR-003**: System MUST display clear pricing information for both the marking product and recommended product before purchase
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve existing marking product functionality (deadline warnings, discount options, submission information) when recommendations are added
- **FR-005**: System MUST NOT display recommendation options when no recommendation relationship exists in the database
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that recommended products have valid pricing before displaying purchase options
- **FR-007**: System MUST add both products to the shopping cart when the user selects the "Buy with Recommended" option
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to distinguish between purchasing the marking product alone versus purchasing with the recommended product
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain visual consistency with existing recommendation UI patterns [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this match the MaterialProductCard SpeedDial implementation?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle discount pricing (retaker/additional copy) appropriately when recommendations are purchased together [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should discounts apply to both products or only the marking product?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ProductVariationRecommendation**: Represents the relationship between a marking product-variation combination and its recommended complementary product (stored in acted_product_productvariation_recommendations table). Key attributes include source product-variation ID and recommended product-variation ID.
- **MarkingProductCard**: The UI component displaying marking products with submission deadlines, pricing, and discount options. Will be extended to display recommended products when applicable.
- **Recommended Product**: The complementary product suggested to users (e.g., study materials for a marking service). Must have valid pricing and availability.

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Existing ProductVariationRecommendation model and database table (acted_product_productvariation_recommendations)
- Existing MaterialProductCard recommendation implementation (SpeedDial pattern with buy_both/recommended_product tiers)
- Existing MarkingProductCard component with deadline management and discount pricing
- Shopping cart functionality for adding multiple products

### Assumptions
- Database entries in acted_product_productvariation_recommendations have been correctly configured for marking products
- Recommended products have valid pricing information in the database
- The recommendation system follows the same one-to-one source relationship pattern as MaterialProductCard (each marking product-variation can recommend at most one complementary product)
- Users can see all product information (deadlines, pricing, recommendations) before making purchase decisions

---

## Business Value
- **Increased Average Order Value**: Users can purchase complementary products (e.g., study materials + marking services) in a single action
- **Improved User Experience**: Reduces friction by suggesting relevant products based on business rules
- **Consistent Shopping Experience**: Marking products will have the same recommendation capabilities as material products
- **Revenue Optimization**: Leverages existing recommendation data to drive additional sales for marking products
