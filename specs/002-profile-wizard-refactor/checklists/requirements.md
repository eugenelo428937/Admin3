# Specification Quality Checklist: Profile Management Wizard

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ All Items Passed

**Content Quality**: All 4 items passed
- Specification is technology-agnostic with no React, Material-UI, or API endpoint details
- Focused entirely on user needs and business value
- Written for non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Entities) completed

**Requirement Completeness**: All 8 items passed
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (made informed decisions documented in Notes section)
- All 33 functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance scenarios
- All 8 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (time, percentages)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "Users see validation feedback in < 100ms" not "React state updates in < 100ms")
- 5 acceptance scenarios + 7 edge cases defined
- Scope clearly bounded to profile management wizard refactor
- 8 assumptions and 5 dependencies documented

**Feature Readiness**: All 4 items passed
- Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios (FR-001 to FR-033 cover all scenarios)
- User scenarios cover registration mode, profile mode, email verification, password change, and incremental saving
- Feature meets all 8 success criteria defined
- No implementation leakage verified

### Specific Validations

**Success Criteria Quality**:
```
✅ "Users can update their profile in under 2 minutes" - Measurable, user-focused
✅ "100% of profile updates save only modified fields" - Quantitative metric
✅ "Verification emails within 30 seconds" - Time-based, measurable
✅ "Single wizard component serves both modes" - Architecture outcome, not implementation
✅ "Users see validation in < 100ms" - User-focused timing metric
```

**Requirements Testability**:
```
✅ FR-001: "MUST provide single multi-step wizard" - Testable via component inspection
✅ FR-010: "MUST detect modified fields by comparing values" - Testable via data diff validation
✅ FR-015: "MUST detect email changes" - Testable via change detection logic
✅ FR-024: "MUST only trigger notification if password changed" - Testable via duplicate password entry
```

**Edge Cases Coverage**:
```
✅ Duplicate email handling
✅ Network failure scenarios
✅ Navigation away (state preservation)
✅ Concurrent edits
✅ Email verification timeout
✅ Password validation requirements
✅ Empty required field handling
```

## Notes

### Informed Decisions (No User Clarification Needed)

The specification successfully avoided [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers by making 8 informed decisions based on industry standards:

1. Component rename default ("UserFormWizard" or "ProfileWizard")
2. Non-destructive step-by-step saving pattern
3. Async email verification with immediate send
4. Always-notify password change policy
5. Client + server-side validation timing
6. User-friendly error messages with retry
7. Last-write-wins concurrent edit resolution
8. 30-minute session validity standard

All decisions documented in spec.md Notes section with rationale.

### Items Marked Complete

All 16 checklist items passed validation:
- **Content Quality**: 4/4
- **Requirement Completeness**: 8/8
- **Feature Readiness**: 4/4

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

Specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.clarify` (if needed) or `/speckit.plan`.
