# Feature Specification: Profile Management Wizard

**Feature Branch**: `002-profile-wizard-refactor`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: "The ProfileForm is quite clunky. Let's reuse the RegistrationWizard to accommodate the requirement for updating user profile. If user clicks on the Profile link from UserActions, it should open the RegistrationWizard. All the fields should have pre-filled from fetching the user profile. It should allow user to save on each step only for the fields that have been updated. If user has updated any email address, it will have to go through the email verification process. If user updated their password, it will create a password_reset_completed email. Then rename the RegistrationWizard to a more appropriate name."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: dual-purpose wizard, profile pre-filling, step saving, email verification, password notifications
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (authenticated users), actions (edit profile, verify email, change password), data (user profile), constraints (step-by-step saving, verification flows)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] - limited to 3 critical items
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User edits profile through multi-step wizard
   ‚Üí Edge cases: Email changes, password changes, partial updates
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and unambiguous
   ‚Üí Cover: component dual-mode, data pre-filling, incremental saves, verification flows
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí User profile data, address information, contact numbers, preferences
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Validate: no implementation details, business-focused, testable requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an authenticated user, I want to update my profile information through a guided multi-step process that saves my changes incrementally, verifies critical changes (email/password), and provides a seamless experience whether I'm registering for the first time or editing my existing profile.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Edit Profile Through Wizard
1. **Given** I am logged in and on the profile page
2. **When** I click the "Profile" menu item
3. **Then** I see a multi-step wizard pre-filled with my current profile data
4. **And** I can navigate through steps (Personal, Home Address, Work Address, Preferences, Security)
5. **And** I can save changes at any step without completing the entire wizard

#### Scenario 2: Update Email Address with Verification
1. **Given** I am editing my profile in step 1 (Personal Information)
2. **When** I change my email address and save
3. **Then** the system saves the new email address
4. **And** sends a verification email to the new address
5. **And** displays a message explaining the verification requirement
6. **And** allows me to continue editing other fields
7. **And** marks the new email as unverified until confirmation

#### Scenario 3: Change Password with Notification
1. **Given** I am editing my profile in step 5 (Security)
2. **When** I enter a new password and confirmation
3. **Then** the system updates my password
4. **And** sends a "password reset completed" notification email to my registered email
5. **And** displays a success message confirming the password change

#### Scenario 4: Incremental Step Saving
1. **Given** I have edited fields in step 2 (Home Address)
2. **When** I click "Save Progress" or navigate to the next step
3. **Then** only the changed fields are saved
4. **And** unchanged fields retain their original values
5. **And** I see a confirmation that changes were saved
6. **And** the wizard remembers my position if I navigate away

#### Scenario 5: Dual-Mode Operation (Registration vs Profile)
1. **Given** I am a new user on the registration page
2. **When** I complete the wizard
3. **Then** I am registered and all fields are saved
4. **And Given** I am an authenticated user on the profile page
5. **When** I complete the wizard
6. **Then** only my changes are saved to my existing profile

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user changes their email to one already in use by another account?
- How does the system handle network failures during step-by-step saving?
- What happens if a user navigates away mid-wizard - are partial changes preserved?
- How does the system handle concurrent profile edits (same user, multiple devices)?
- What happens if email verification fails or times out?
- How does the system validate password strength requirements?
- What happens if a user tries to save an empty required field?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Component Behavior
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a single multi-step wizard component that supports both new user registration and existing user profile editing
- **FR-002**: System MUST distinguish between registration mode (new user) and profile mode (existing user) through the entry point
- **FR-003**: System MUST display different titles and button labels based on mode ("Register" vs "Update Profile")
- **FR-004**: System MUST rename the wizard component to reflect its dual purpose (registration and profile management)

#### Data Pre-filling
- **FR-005**: System MUST fetch current user profile data when opening the wizard in profile mode
- **FR-006**: System MUST pre-populate all wizard fields with the user's existing data

- **FR-016**: System MUST trigger an email verification process when the email changes
- **FR-017**: System MUST send a verification email to the new email address
- **FR-018**: System MUST display an informational message explaining the email verification requirement
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow users to continue editing other profile fields while email is unverified
- **FR-020**: System MUST mark the new email as unverified until the user clicks the verification link

#### Password Change Notification
- **FR-021**: System MUST detect when a user changes their password during profile editing
- **FR-022**: System MUST send a "password reset completed" notification email when password changes
- **FR-023**: System MUST display a success message confirming the password change
- **FR-024**: System MUST only trigger password notification if the password actually changed (not re-entered same value)

#### Validation
- **FR-025**: System MUST validate required fields before allowing save operations
- **FR-026**: System MUST display field-level validation errors immediately when users attempt to save
- **FR-027**: System MUST enforce password strength requirements (minimum length, complexity)

- **FR-033**: System MUST allow users to exit the wizard at any time, preserving saved changes

### Success Criteria

Success criteria are measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes that validate the feature:

1. **User Experience**: Users can update their profile information in under 2 minutes for simple changes (name, address)
2. **Data Integrity**: 100% of profile updates save only the fields that were actually modified
3. **Email Verification**: Users receive verification emails within 30 seconds of changing their email address
4. **Password Security**: Users receive password change notifications within 30 seconds of updating their password
5. **Component Reusability**: Single wizard component serves both registration and profile editing with no code duplication
6. **Error Recovery**: Users can recover from network errors during saving without losing their edited data
7. **Field Validation**: Users see validation feedback immediately (< 100ms) after attempting to save invalid data
8. **Save Performance**: Step-by-step saves complete in under 1 second under normal network conditions

### Key Entities *(mandatory - feature involves data)*

- **User Profile**: Represents a registered user's personal information
  - Basic Info: Title, first name, last name, email
  - Verification Status: Email verified flag, verification timestamp

- **Home Address**: User's primary residential address
  - Components: Building, street, district, town, county, postcode, state, country

- **Work Address** (Optional): User's workplace address
  - Components: Company, department, building, street, district, town, county, postcode, state, country

- **Security Credentials**: User authentication information
  - Password: Encrypted storage, strength requirements
  - Password Change History: For notification tracking

### Assumptions

1. **Email Verification Process**: The backend already has an email verification system that generates and validates verification tokens
2. **Password Notification Template**: The system has a pre-existing email template for "password_reset_completed" notifications
3. **User Authentication**: Users accessing the profile wizard are already authenticated with valid sessions
4. **Data Persistence**: The backend supports partial updates (PATCH semantics) for profile data
5. **Concurrent Editing**: Last-write-wins conflict resolution strategy for concurrent profile edits
6. **Session Management**: User sessions remain valid throughout the wizard flow (minimum 30 minutes)
7. **Network Resilience**: The frontend has basic retry logic for failed API calls
8. **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with JavaScript enabled (last 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Dependencies

1. **Backend API Endpoints**: Profile data retrieval, partial update, email verification trigger, password change notification
2. **Email Service**: Email delivery system for verification and notification emails
3. **User Service**: User profile management and authentication services
4. **Current Components**: Existing RegistrationWizard component structure and SmartAddressInput component
5. **Validation Rules**: Existing business rules for email format, password strength, required fields

## Notes

### Informed Decisions Made (No Clarification Needed)

1. **Component Rename**: Reasonable default is "UserFormWizard" or "ProfileWizard" - reflects dual purpose
2. **Save Behavior**: Step-by-step saving is non-destructive (preserves unsaved steps) - standard UX pattern
3. **Email Verification**: Async verification with immediate email send - industry standard for email changes
4. **Password Notification**: Always notify on password change - security best practice
5. **Validation Timing**: Client-side validation on save attempt, server-side validation on submit - standard approach
6. **Error Handling**: User-friendly messages with retry options - standard error UX
7. **Data Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins for concurrent edits - simplest approach, documented in assumptions
8. **Session Timeout**: 30-minute minimum session validity - standard web application timeout

These decisions are based on industry standards and common UX patterns. They do not require user clarification as they represent reasonable defaults that can be adjusted during implementation if needed.
