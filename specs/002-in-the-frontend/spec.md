# Feature Specification: Scrollable Filter Groups in FilterPanel

**Feature Branch**: `002-in-the-frontend`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "In the frontend/react-Admin3/src/components/Product/FilterPanel.js, sometimes the list for a filter group is too long. For example the subject filter list. For each filter group, make it have a appropriate max-height and scrollable for any overflow. Work in the current branch."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: Add scrollable containers to filter groups in FilterPanel
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users browsing products with filters
   ‚Üí Actions: View filter lists, scroll through long filter options
   ‚Üí Data: Filter groups (subjects, categories, product types, etc.)
   ‚Üí Constraints: Long lists exceed viewable area
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Resolved: Max-height values (Desktop: 50vh, Mobile: 40vh)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User scenario defined: Browsing products with long filter lists
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Filter groups, filter options
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All critical ambiguities resolved via clarifications
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-28
- Q: What maximum height should be applied to scrollable filter groups? ‚Üí A: Desktop: 50vh, Mobile: 40vh (viewport-relative, adapts to screen size)
- Q: Should short filter lists bypass the max-height constraint entirely? ‚Üí A: Adaptive: bypass if total height < max-height threshold
- Q: Should the max-height (50vh/40vh) be the final value, or should it adapt further based on other factors? ‚Üí A: Dynamically adjust to ensure filter panel never exceeds viewport height
- Q: Should keyboard focus automatically scroll the active option into view when navigating with Tab/Arrow keys? ‚Üí A: Yes, auto-scroll focused option to visible area (standard a11y pattern)
- Q: Should specific ARIA attributes be added to scrollable filter regions for screen reader users? ‚Üí A: Yes, add role="region" and aria-label to identify scrollable areas

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user browsing products on the store, when I open the filter panel to refine my product search, I need to see all available filter options within each category (especially subjects which have many options) without the list overwhelming the page layout. Long filter lists should be contained within a scrollable area so I can access all options while maintaining a clean, organized interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the products page with the filter panel open, **When** viewing a filter group where the option list exceeds the maximum height threshold (e.g., subjects with many options), **Then** the filter list displays up to the maximum height (50vh desktop, 40vh mobile) and provides a vertical scrollbar to access additional options.

2. **Given** a user is viewing a filter group with scrollable overflow, **When** they scroll through the list, **Then** the checkbox labels and counts remain aligned and readable, and the accordion header stays visible and fixed.

3. **Given** a user is on a mobile device with the filter drawer open, **When** viewing a long filter list, **Then** the scrollable area adjusts appropriately for the smaller viewport while maintaining touch-friendly scrolling.

4. **Given** a user has filters applied in a long, scrollable list, **When** they scroll to view their selected options, **Then** checked items remain visible and accessible regardless of scroll position.

### Edge Cases
- **Short lists**: Filter groups with few options (where total height < max-height) display naturally without scrolling; max-height constraint only applies when content exceeds the threshold.
- **Viewport resizing**: When the user resizes their browser window, the max-height dynamically adjusts to ensure the filter panel remains fully visible without requiring page-level scrolling.
- **Multiple expanded panels**: When multiple accordion panels are expanded simultaneously, the system ensures the total filter panel height stays within the viewport by dynamically adjusting individual panel max-heights if necessary.
- **Keyboard navigation**: When users navigate scrollable filter lists with Tab or Arrow keys, the focused option automatically scrolls into view, ensuring keyboard-only users can always see which option has focus.
- **Screen reader accessibility**: Scrollable filter regions include role="region" and descriptive aria-label attributes, allowing screen reader users to identify scrollable areas and understand their purpose.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST apply a maximum height constraint to each filter group's option list (AccordionDetails content area) to prevent excessively long lists from dominating the interface.

- **FR-002**: System MUST provide vertical scrolling functionality when a filter group's options exceed the maximum height constraint.

- **FR-003**: System MUST display a visual scrollbar indicator when filter options overflow the maximum height.

- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain the accordion header (filter group title, badge, clear button) in a fixed, visible position while the option list scrolls independently.

- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve the selected state and visual indicators (checkboxes, counts) for all filter options regardless of scroll position.

- **FR-006**: System MUST provide smooth, responsive scrolling behavior that works with mouse wheel, trackpad, touch gestures, and keyboard navigation.

- **FR-007**: System MUST apply a maximum height of 50vh (50% of viewport height) to desktop views and 40vh to mobile drawer views, ensuring the scrollable area adapts to different screen sizes.

- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain consistent spacing, padding, and alignment of filter options within scrollable areas.

- **FR-009**: System MUST dynamically adjust the max-height constraint when viewport size changes to ensure the entire filter panel (including all expanded groups) never exceeds the viewport height, preventing the filter panel from being cut off or requiring page-level scrolling.

- **FR-010**: System MUST provide accessible navigation through scrollable filter lists for keyboard-only users, automatically scrolling focused options into view when navigating with Tab or Arrow keys to ensure keyboard users can always see which option has focus.

- **FR-011**: System MUST add appropriate ARIA attributes to scrollable filter regions, including role="region" and descriptive aria-label attributes, to ensure screen reader users can identify and navigate scrollable areas effectively.

### Key Entities
- **Filter Group**: A collapsible section containing a category of filter options (e.g., Subjects, Categories, Product Types). Each group has a title, optional badge showing active count, and a list of selectable options.

- **Filter Option**: An individual checkbox item within a filter group, displaying the option label (e.g., "CM2", "Bundle") and the count of matching products.

## Open Questions for Planning Phase

1. **Accessibility requirements**:
   - Should there be a "jump to top" affordance for long lists?
