## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users applying filters to browse products currently experience inconsistent behavior where cleared filters reappear after page refresh, and applied filters don't persist when sharing URLs with colleagues. Users need filters to work predictably: when they clear filters, they stay cleared; when they apply filters and share the URL, recipients see the same filtered results; when they refresh the page, their selected filters remain active.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Clear All Filters
1. **Given** user has applied multiple product filters (subject, category, product type)
2. **When** user clicks "Clear All Filters" button
3. **Then** all filters are removed from the interface
4. **And** the browser URL updates to show no filter parameters
5. **And** refreshing the page shows no filters applied (filters don't reappear)

#### Scenario 2: Filter Persistence on Page Refresh
1. **Given** user has selected "CB1" subject and "Materials" category filters
2. **When** user refreshes the browser page
3. **Then** both "CB1" and "Materials" filters remain selected
4. **And** the filtered product list displays the same results as before refresh

#### Scenario 3: Shareable Filter URLs
1. **Given** user has applied filters to narrow down products
2. **When** user copies the browser URL and shares it with a colleague
3. **Then** the colleague opens the URL in their browser
4. **And** they see the exact same filters applied
5. **And** they see the same filtered product results

#### Scenario 4: Navigation Filters Integration
1. **Given** user navigates to products using main navigation menu shortcuts
2. **When** navigation applies pre-selected filters (e.g., "Tutorial Products" link)
3. **Then** the filters are visible in the filter panel
4. **And** the filters can be removed like any other filter
5. **And** the URL reflects the navigation-applied filters

#### Scenario 5: Filter Changes Update URL
1. **Given** user is on the products page
2. **When** user selects any filter (subject, category, tutorial format, etc.)
3. **Then** the browser URL immediately updates to include that filter parameter
4. **And** bookmarking the URL saves the current filter state
5. **And** the browser back/forward buttons work with filter states

#### Scenario 6: Search Box Integration
1. **Given** user enters search text in the search box
2. **When** user also applies filters
3. **Then** search text and filters work together to narrow results
4. **And** both search text and filters persist in URL
5. **And** refreshing the page preserves both search and filters

### Edge Cases
- What happens when URL contains invalid filter parameters? ‚Üí System ignores invalid parameters gracefully
- What happens when user applies filters then uses browser back button? ‚Üí Previous filter state is restored
- What happens when filters change very rapidly (user clicking many filters quickly)? ‚Üí All filter changes are captured without loss, URL updates efficiently without creating excessive history entries
- What happens when user shares URL but product catalog has changed? ‚Üí Filters still apply correctly even if specific products no longer exist
- What happens when no products match the selected filters? ‚Üí User sees "No products found" message with option to clear filters

- **FR-035**: System MUST validate filter values and ignore invalid parameters gracefully

#### Performance
- **FR-036**: System MUST update URL within 5 milliseconds of filter change
- **FR-037**: System MUST not cause noticeable delay when users toggle filters

- **FR-040**: System MUST show active filters from navigation menu in same way as manually applied filters
- **FR-041**: Users MUST be able to see which filters are currently active at all times

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

## Additional Context

### Feature Scope
This specification covers **Phase 1 - Critical Fixes** of the product filtering refactoring, specifically stories 1.1 through 1.6:

- **Story 1.1**: Automatic URL synchronization when filters change
- **Story 1.2**: Integration of navigation filters into main filter state
- **Story 1.3**: Removal of manual URL manipulation code
- **Story 1.4**: Consolidation of navigation filter handling
- **Story 1.5**: Verification of "Clear All" functionality
- **Story 1.6**: Restoration of filters from URL on page load

### User Impact
This phase fixes critical user-facing bugs:
- ‚úÖ Fixes "Clear All" button not working correctly
- ‚úÖ Makes filter URLs shareable and bookmarkable
- ‚úÖ Prevents filters from mysteriously reappearing after refresh
- ‚úÖ Makes navigation shortcuts work consistently with manual filters
- ‚úÖ Ensures search and filters work together properly

### Success Metrics
- Filter URLs can be shared and work for all recipients (100% success rate)
- "Clear All" button clears filters permanently (no reappearance)
- Page refresh preserves filter state (100% accuracy)
- All filter changes reflect in URL within 5ms
- Zero race conditions between filter state and URL state

### Dependencies
- Requires existing Redux filter state structure
- Requires browser History API support
- Requires React Router for URL handling
- No breaking changes to existing filter UI components

### Out of Scope
- Visual redesign of filter interface (handled in later phases)
- Advanced filter validation logic (handled in Phase 3)
- Performance monitoring (handled in Phase 3)
- Comprehensive testing suite (handled in Phase 4)
- Architecture improvements (handled in Phase 3)
