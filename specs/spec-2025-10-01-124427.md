## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a customer browsing tutorial products, I want a more streamlined interface for accessing tutorial actions (Add to Cart, Select Tutorial, View Selections), so that I can interact with tutorial products in a cleaner, more modern way without visual clutter.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am viewing a tutorial product card, **When** I look at the card actions area, **Then** I should see a single floating action button (Speed Dial) instead of multiple separate buttons

2. **Given** I have not selected any tutorials yet, **When** I click the Speed Dial button, **Then** I should see only the "Select Tutorial" action available

3. **Given** I have selected tutorials, **When** I click the Speed Dial button, **Then** I should see three actions: "Add to Cart", "Select Tutorial", and "View Selections"

4. **Given** the Speed Dial is open, **When** I click the "Select Tutorial" action, **Then** the tutorial selection dialog should open

5. **Given** the Speed Dial is open and I have selections, **When** I click "View Selections", **Then** the selections panel should open

6. **Given** the Speed Dial is open and I have selections, **When** I click "Add to Cart", **Then** my selected tutorials should be added to my shopping cart

7. **Given** the Speed Dial is open, **When** I click outside the Speed Dial area or click the close button, **Then** the Speed Dial should close

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Speed Dial is open and I navigate away from the page?
  ‚Üí Speed Dial should close automatically
- What happens when I have no tutorials selected and try to view selections?
  ‚Üí "View Selections" action should be hidden
- What happens when I have no tutorials selected and try to add to cart?
  ‚Üí "Add to Cart" action should be hidden
- How does the Speed Dial behave on mobile devices with touch interactions?
  ‚Üí Should work with touch events and remain accessible

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**UI Simplification**
- **FR-001**: System MUST replace the separate "Select Tutorial" and "View Selection" buttons with a single Speed Dial button
- **FR-002**: Speed Dial button MUST be positioned in the same location as the current "Add to Cart" button (bottom-right of card actions area)
- **FR-003**: Speed Dial MUST display a "+" icon in its default closed state

**Speed Dial Interaction**
- **FR-004**: Speed Dial MUST open upward when clicked, revealing action options
- **FR-005**: Speed Dial icon MUST rotate 45 degrees when opening, transforming the "+" into an "√ó" close indicator
- **FR-006**: Speed Dial MUST remain open until the user explicitly closes it by clicking the close button or clicking outside the Speed Dial area
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a backdrop overlay when Speed Dial is open to indicate the active state and provide a click target for closing

**Speed Dial Actions**
- **FR-008**: Speed Dial MUST provide three possible actions: "Add to Cart", "Select Tutorial", and "View Selections"
- **FR-009**: Each action MUST display an appropriate icon (cart icon, calendar icon, and view/list icon respectively)
- **FR-010**: Each action MUST display a tooltip with the action name

**Conditional Visibility**
- **FR-011**: "Add to Cart" action MUST be hidden when the user has not selected any tutorials
- **FR-012**: "View Selections" action MUST be hidden when the user has not selected any tutorials
- **FR-013**: "Select Tutorial" action MUST always be visible regardless of selection state

**Action Behaviors**
- **FR-014**: Clicking "Select Tutorial" action MUST open the tutorial selection dialog
- **FR-015**: Clicking "View Selections" action MUST open the tutorial selections panel
- **FR-016**: Clicking "Add to Cart" action MUST add the selected tutorials to the shopping cart
- **FR-017**: After any action is clicked, the Speed Dial MUST close automatically

**Integration & Compatibility**
- **FR-018**: System MUST maintain all existing tutorial selection functionality without regression
- **FR-019**: Tutorial selection dialog MUST continue to work exactly as before
- **FR-020**: Tutorial selections panel MUST continue to work exactly as before
- **FR-021**: Shopping cart integration MUST continue to work exactly as before

**Accessibility & Responsiveness**
- **FR-022**: Speed Dial MUST support keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape keys)
- **FR-023**: Speed Dial actions MUST be accessible to screen readers with appropriate ARIA labels
- **FR-024**: Speed Dial MUST work correctly on both desktop and mobile devices
- **FR-025**: Speed Dial MUST work correctly with touch interactions on mobile devices

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Usability**
- **NFR-001**: Speed Dial interaction MUST feel responsive with smooth animations (icon rotation, action expansion)
- **NFR-002**: Users MUST be able to understand the purpose of the Speed Dial without additional training

**Performance**
- **NFR-003**: Speed Dial opening/closing MUST be instantaneous (< 300ms animation time)
- **NFR-004**: UI change MUST not impact page load time or render performance

**Compatibility**
- **NFR-005**: Feature MUST work on all browsers currently supported by the application
- **NFR-006**: Feature MUST work on all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

### Key Entities *(not applicable - UI-only change)*

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs (cleaner, more modern interface)
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (visible button count, action availability, interaction behaviors)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (UI-only change to tutorial product cards)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (existing tutorial selection system must continue to work)

---

## Success Criteria

The feature is successfully delivered when:

1. **Visual Simplification**: Tutorial product cards display a single Speed Dial button instead of multiple separate action buttons
2. **Interaction Quality**: Speed Dial opens/closes smoothly with proper icon rotation and backdrop overlay
3. **Conditional Logic**: "Add to Cart" and "View Selections" actions are only visible when user has selected tutorials
4. **Functional Preservation**: All existing tutorial selection, viewing, and cart addition functionality works without regression
5. **Accessibility**: Speed Dial is fully accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers
6. **Responsiveness**: Speed Dial works correctly on all device sizes and with touch interactions
7. **User Feedback**: Internal testing confirms the interface feels cleaner and more modern

---

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly **not** included in this feature:

- Changes to the tutorial selection dialog functionality or UI
- Changes to the tutorial selections panel functionality or UI
- Changes to shopping cart functionality
- Changes to any other product card types (materials, bundles, etc.)
- Changes to tutorial pricing or discount logic
- Backend API changes
- Database schema changes
- Changes to tutorial availability or booking logic

---

## Execution Status

- [x] User description parsed
- [x] Key concepts extracted (Speed Dial, action consolidation, conditional visibility)
- [x] Ambiguities marked (none - brownfield story provides clear specifications)
- [x] User scenarios defined (7 acceptance scenarios, 4 edge cases)
- [x] Requirements generated (25 functional, 6 non-functional)
- [x] Entities identified (N/A - UI-only change)
