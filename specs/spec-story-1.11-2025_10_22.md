## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer maintaining the product filtering system, I need a centralized registry that defines all filter types and their properties so that adding a new filter requires only one configuration entry instead of modifying 6+ files, reducing development time and the risk of inconsistencies.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new filter type needs to be added (e.g., "tutorial_location"), **When** the developer adds a single registry entry, **Then** the filter should automatically appear in FilterPanel, ActiveFilters, and URL conversions without modifying any component files

2. **Given** a filter configuration is registered with specific display properties, **When** FilterPanel renders, **Then** the filter section should use the registered label, color, and rendering strategy

3. **Given** multiple filter types are registered, **When** querying all filters, **Then** they should be returned in the configured display order

4. **Given** a URL parameter is received, **When** looking up the corresponding filter type, **Then** the system should find the filter by primary parameter name or any registered alias

5. **Given** filter configurations define data types (array, boolean, string), **When** rendering filter controls, **Then** appropriate UI components should be used (checkboxes for arrays, toggle for booleans, etc.)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a filter configuration is missing required fields?
  - System should throw validation error during registration
- How does system handle duplicate filter type registrations?
  - System should allow re-registration (last registration wins) or throw error for duplicates
- What if a component requests an unregistered filter type?
  - System should return undefined and log warning
- How are display orders handled when not explicitly specified?
  - System should use default order value (e.g., 100) for unspecified orders

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a centralized registry for filter type configurations
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate filter configurations during registration (type, label, urlParam required)
- **FR-003**: System MUST register all existing filter types: subjects, categories, product_types, products, modes_of_delivery, tutorial_format, distance_learning, tutorial, searchQuery
- **FR-004**: Filter configurations MUST include metadata: type, label, pluralLabel, urlParam, urlParamAliases, color, multiple, dataType, urlFormat, getDisplayValue, icon (optional), order
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide method to retrieve filter configuration by type
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide method to retrieve all filter configurations in display order
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide method to find filter by URL parameter name (including aliases)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide query methods for specific filter subsets (multiple-select filters, boolean filters, array filters)
- **FR-009**: FilterPanel component MUST read filter configurations from registry and render sections generically
- **FR-010**: ActiveFilters component MUST read chip configurations from registry instead of hardcoded mapping
- **FR-011**: FilterUrlManager utility MUST read URL parameter mappings from registry
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain visual consistency when switching to registry-based rendering (no UI changes visible to users)
- **FR-013**: Adding a new filter type MUST require only: (1) registry entry, (2) Redux state field and actions
- **FR-014**: System MUST support future extension with additional configuration properties (validation, searchable, defaultValue)
- **FR-015**: Registry pattern MUST be backward compatible with existing filter behavior

### Key Entities

- **FilterRegistry**: Centralized storage and retrieval system for filter configurations
  - Registration operations: register, clear
  - Query operations: get, getAll, getByUrlParam, has
  - Filter operations: getMultipleSelectFilters, getBooleanFilters, getArrayFilters

- **FilterConfig**: Configuration object defining a filter type's properties
  - Identity: type, label, pluralLabel
  - URL mapping: urlParam, urlParamAliases, urlFormat
  - Display: color, icon, order
  - Behavior: multiple, dataType, getDisplayValue
  - Future: validation, searchable, defaultValue

- **Generic Filter Rendering**: Components that read from registry to render filters
  - FilterPanel: Renders accordion sections based on registered filters
  - ActiveFilters: Renders chips based on registered configurations
  - FilterUrlManager: Converts based on registered URL mappings

## Success Criteria

1. **Shotgun Surgery Eliminated**: Adding new filter requires changes in 1-2 files instead of 6+ files
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: System is open for extension (add filters) without modification (change components)
3. **Code Reduction**: Filter rendering code reduced by eliminating hardcoded sections
4. **Maintainability**: Filter metadata centralized in single location
5. **Test Coverage**: Registry achieves ‚â•90% code coverage
6. **Visual Consistency**: No visible UI changes after migration to registry-based rendering
7. **Developer Experience**: New filter addition documented as simple 3-step process

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Story 1.7 (FilterPanel extended with navbar filters)
- Story 1.8 (ActiveFilters extended with navbar filters)
- Story 1.10 (FilterUrlManager utility created)

### Assumptions
- All filter types have consistent configuration needs
- Generic rendering can handle all current and future filter types
- Filter data (e.g., list of subjects) is provided separately from configuration
- Performance impact of registry lookups is negligible

---

## Out of Scope

- Dynamically loading filter configurations from backend API
- User-configurable filter display order
- Filter configuration UI for administrators
- A/B testing different filter presentations
- Multi-language filter labels (i18n)
- Filter analytics or usage tracking

---

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Generic Rendering Too Rigid
**Impact**: High
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Design registry with extension points for custom rendering strategies; allow configuration properties to be expanded

### Risk 2: Performance Overhead from Registry Lookups
**Impact**: Low
**Probability**: Low
**Mitigation**: Registry uses Map data structure for O(1) lookups; queries execute in microseconds

### Risk 3: Incomplete Migration
**Impact**: Medium
**Probability**: Low
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive code search identifies all hardcoded filter definitions; integration tests verify registry-based rendering

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Create Registry
- Implement FilterRegistry class with all configuration schema
- Register all existing filter types
- Add comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 2: Migrate FilterPanel
- Replace hardcoded filter sections with registry-based rendering
- Verify visual consistency
- Update component tests

### Phase 3: Migrate ActiveFilters
- Replace FILTER_CONFIG mapping with registry queries
- Verify chip rendering consistency
- Update component tests

### Phase 4: Migrate FilterUrlManager
- Use registry for URL parameter mappings
- Verify bidirectional conversion still works
- Update utility tests

### Phase 5: Documentation
- Create "How to Add a New Filter" developer guide
- Document registry configuration options
- Update architecture documentation
