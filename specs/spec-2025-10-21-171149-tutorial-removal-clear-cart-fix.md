## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As a tutorial purchaser**, I want to be able to completely remove my tutorial selections from both my draft choices and my shopping cart, so that I can change my mind about tutorial purchases without leaving orphaned selections or confusing state in the system.

**Business Value**: Ensures users have reliable control over their tutorial selections, preventing confusion and potential purchase errors. Builds trust in the system by providing predictable removal behavior.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Remove Draft Tutorial Selection
1. **Given** user has selected tutorials but has not yet added them to cart (draft state)
2. **When** user clicks the Remove button on the tutorial summary
3. **Then** the tutorial selections disappear from the summary
4. **And** the selections are permanently removed (do not reappear after page refresh)
5. **And** the summary bar for that subject is hidden (if no other choices remain)

#### Scenario 2: Remove Tutorial Already in Cart
1. **Given** user has added tutorial selections to their shopping cart
2. **When** user clicks the Remove button on the tutorial summary
3. **Then** the tutorial selections are removed from the cart
4. **And** the cart total is recalculated to exclude the removed tutorials
5. **And** the cart item count decreases accordingly
6. **And** the tutorial summary bar disappears
7. **And** the selections are permanently removed (do not reappear after page refresh)

#### Scenario 3: Remove Mixed Tutorial Selections (Draft + Carted)
1. **Given** user has some tutorial choices in draft state and others already added to cart for the same subject
2. **When** user clicks the Remove button on the tutorial summary
3. **Then** ALL tutorial choices for that subject are removed (both draft and carted)
4. **And** the cart is updated to remove the carted items
5. **And** the summary bar for that subject disappears
6. **And** no tutorial selections persist after page refresh

#### Scenario 4: Clear Entire Shopping Cart
1. **Given** user has multiple items in cart including tutorial selections
2. **When** user clicks the "Clear Cart" button
3. **Then** ALL cart items are removed (tutorials and non-tutorials)
4. **And** ALL tutorial selections are cleared (draft and carted)
5. **And** ALL tutorial summary bars disappear
6. **And** after page refresh, no tutorial selections or cart items reappear
7. **And** user sees empty cart state

#### Scenario 5: Clear Cart with Only Tutorial Selections
1. **Given** user has only tutorial selections in cart (no other products)
2. **When** user clicks "Clear Cart"
3. **Then** cart is emptied
4. **And** all tutorial summary bars disappear
5. **And** no tutorial selections persist in system storage
6. **And** user can start fresh tutorial selections without residual state

### Edge Cases

#### Error Handling
- **What happens when network request to remove cart item fails?**
  - System shows error message to user
  - Tutorial selections remain in cart (state rollback)
  - User can retry removal operation

- **What happens when user has slow/intermittent connection?**
  - System shows loading indicator during removal
  - User cannot perform other cart operations until current operation completes
  - Timeout after reasonable period with error message

#### Concurrent Operations
- **What happens when user removes tutorial while cart is being modified by another action?**
  - Operations queue to prevent conflicts
  - Each operation completes fully before next begins
  - User sees loading state during queued operations

#### Data Persistence
- **What happens when user refreshes page immediately after clearing cart?**
  - Cart remains empty (backend is source of truth)
  - No tutorial selections reappear (storage cleared before navigation)
  - System loads clean state from backend

#### Partial Failures
- **What happens when some tutorials in a subject are removed but others fail?**
  - System attempts to rollback to previous state
  - User sees error indicating which specific tutorials failed
  - User can retry operation for failed items

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Remove Button Functionality

- **FR-003**: System MUST hide the tutorial summary bar for a subject when all its selections are removed
- **FR-004**: System MUST update the shopping cart total and item count when removing carted tutorial selections
- **FR-005**: System MUST permanently delete removed tutorial selections from system storage

#### Clear Cart Functionality
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a Clear Cart button that removes ALL items from the shopping cart
- **FR-007**: System MUST clear ALL tutorial selections (draft and carted) when Clear Cart is executed
- **FR-008**: System MUST hide ALL tutorial summary bars when cart is cleared
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent tutorial selections from persisting after cart is cleared and page is refreshed

#### State Management
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain consistency between tutorial summary display and shopping cart contents
- **FR-011**: System MUST clear tutorial selections from all storage locations when removed (draft state, cart state, persistent storage)
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure removed tutorial selections do not reappear after page refresh or user session change

#### User Feedback
- **FR-013**: System MUST display loading indicator while removal operations are in progress
- **FR-014**: System MUST display error message when removal operation fails
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow user to retry failed removal operations

#### Data Integrity
- **FR-016**: System MUST rollback partial removal operations if any part fails (all-or-nothing for a subject's selections)
- **FR-017**: System MUST prevent concurrent removal operations from causing data inconsistency
- **FR-018**: System MUST maintain cart total accuracy after removal operations

### Key Entities

- **Tutorial Choice**: Represents a user's selection of a specific tutorial event for a subject
  - Has a choice level (1st, 2nd, or 3rd preference)
  - Has a state (draft or carted)
  - Belongs to a subject
  - Contains tutorial event details (location, date, code)
  - Can be removed individually or as part of subject group

- **Tutorial Summary Bar**: Visual representation of tutorial selections for a subject
  - Displays all tutorial choices for a single subject
  - Contains Remove button to clear all choices
  - Appears/disappears based on presence of selections
  - Shows visual indicator for carted vs draft selections

- **Shopping Cart**: Collection of items user intends to purchase
  - Contains tutorial selections in carted state
  - Contains non-tutorial product items
  - Has Clear Cart action that removes all items
  - Maintains total cost and item count
  - Persists across user sessions until checkout or clearing

- **Selection State**: The lifecycle state of a tutorial choice
  - Draft: Selected by user but not yet added to cart
  - Carted: Added to shopping cart for purchase
  - Removed: Permanently deleted from system

## Notes for Implementation Team

When implementing this specification:

1. **Focus on complete removal** - The key user pain point is partial or incomplete removal leaving orphaned data
2. **Test persistence thoroughly** - Verify no data remains after page refresh in multiple scenarios
3. **Handle all failure modes** - Network failures, partial completions, concurrent operations
4. **Maintain cart integrity** - Cart totals and item counts must stay accurate through all operations
5. **Follow existing patterns** - This is a brownfield fix - maintain consistency with existing cart removal behavior
