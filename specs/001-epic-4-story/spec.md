## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a tutorial purchaser, I want the tutorial summary bar and shopping cart to always show the same tutorial selections, so that I have a consistent view of my choices and can trust that what I see in the summary bar matches what will be purchased.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Single Tutorial Addition**
   - **Given** user is viewing tutorial selection dialog
   - **When** user adds CS1-30-25S (Edinburgh) from TutorialSelectionDialog
   - **Then** summary bar displays CS1-30-25S (Edinburgh)
   - **And** cart item count increases by 1
   - **And** cart panel shows CS1-30-25S (Edinburgh) when opened

2. **Multiple Tutorial Addition**
   - **Given** user has no tutorials selected
   - **When** user adds CS1-30-25S (Edinburgh) followed by CS1-20-25S (London)
   - **Then** summary bar shows BOTH CS1-30-25S AND CS1-20-25S
   - **And** cart shows BOTH tutorials (not just the second one)
   - **And** cart item metadata correctly reflects both selections

3. **Add to Cart from Summary Bar**
   - **Given** summary bar shows draft tutorial selections
   - **When** user clicks "Add to Cart" button on summary bar
   - **Then** ALL draft selections for that subject are added to cart
   - **And** summary bar choices show "Added in Cart" badge
   - **And** cart panel displays all selections correctly
   - **And** choices are marked as non-draft in the system

4. **State Persistence After Page Refresh**
   - **Given** tutorials have been added to cart
   - **When** user refreshes the page
   - **Then** cart loads tutorial selections from backend
   - **And** summary bar shows choices matching cart state
   - **And** draft flags are consistent with cart state

5. **Remove Tutorial from Cart**
   - **Given** cart contains multiple tutorial selections
   - **When** user removes a specific tutorial from cart
   - **Then** only the selected tutorial is removed
   - **And** remaining tutorials stay in cart
   - **And** summary bar updates to reflect the removal

6. **Clear All Cart Items**
   - **Given** cart contains tutorial selections
   - **When** user clears the cart
   - **Then** all tutorial selections are removed from cart
   - **And** summary bar shows no selections
   - **And** no selections persist after page refresh

### Edge Cases

1. **Rapid Sequential Additions**
   - What happens when user adds multiple tutorials in quick succession (< 500ms between additions)?
   - System MUST queue operations or handle concurrent state updates without data loss

2. **API Failure During Add to Cart**
   - What happens when backend cart API call fails?
   - System MUST rollback local state changes and show error message

3. **State Mismatch After Refresh**
   - What happens when localStorage and backend cart are out of sync?
   - System MUST reconcile states on page load, with backend as source of truth

4. **Concurrent User Sessions**
   - What happens when user has multiple browser tabs open and modifies cart in one tab?
   - System SHOULD sync cart state across tabs (if technically feasible)

5. **Partial Cart Update Failure**
   - What happens when updating existing cart item fails?
   - System MUST maintain previous cart state and notify user

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Display Consistency
- **FR-001**: System MUST display identical tutorial selections in both summary bar and cart panel at all times
- **FR-002**: System MUST update summary bar immediately when cart contents change
- **FR-003**: System MUST update cart panel immediately when summary bar selections change
- **FR-004**: System MUST show correct item counts in cart badge matching actual cart contents

#### Data Integrity
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve all tutorial selections when adding multiple tutorials sequentially
- **FR-006**: System MUST not overwrite existing selections when adding new selections
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain correct tutorial metadata for each selection (location, dates, prices)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle concurrent add-to-cart operations without data loss

#### State Synchronization
- **FR-009**: System MUST synchronize tutorial choices between local storage and backend cart on page load
- **FR-010**: System MUST use backend cart as authoritative source of truth for non-draft selections
- **FR-011**: System MUST use local storage for draft selections not yet added to cart
- **FR-012**: System MUST mark selections as non-draft when successfully added to backend cart
- **FR-013**: System MUST restore both draft and carted selections after page refresh

#### User Operations
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow users to add tutorials from selection dialog to draft state
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow users to add all draft selections to cart via summary bar button
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow users to remove individual tutorials from cart
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow users to clear all cart contents at once
- **FR-018**: System MUST show appropriate loading states during cart operations
- **FR-019**: System MUST show clear error messages when cart operations fail

#### Error Recovery
- **FR-020**: System MUST rollback local state changes when backend cart operations fail
- **FR-021**: System MUST retry failed cart operations with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts)
- **FR-022**: System MUST notify users of persistent failures and provide recovery options
- **FR-023**: System MUST maintain data consistency even during network interruptions

#### Performance
- **FR-024**: System MUST complete cart synchronization within 2 seconds of page load
- **FR-025**: System MUST complete add-to-cart operations within 3 seconds under normal conditions
- **FR-026**: System MUST show progress indicators for operations exceeding 1 second

### Key Entities

- **TutorialChoice**: Represents a user's selection of a tutorial with specific attributes
  - Links to specific tutorial event (location, date, price)
  - Has draft status (true = not yet added to cart, false = in cart)
  - Associated with subject code and choice level
  - Contains product metadata for cart operations

- **CartItem**: Represents an item in the user's shopping cart
  - Contains product information and pricing
  - May contain multiple tutorial selections (metadata)
  - Has backend persistence with unique ID
  - Synced with local storage for offline access

- **TutorialMetadata**: Structured data within cart items representing tutorial selections
  - Contains event details (location, date, session)
  - Links back to tutorial choices
  - Used for display in cart and summary bar
  - Must remain consistent across all UI components

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### Dependencies
- **Story 1 Completion**: This story builds on stable cart removal/clear functionality from Story 1
- **Existing System**: Integrates with TutorialChoiceContext, CartContext, and localStorage persistence layer
- **Backend API**: Relies on existing cart API endpoints for persistence

### Assumptions
1. Backend cart API is stable and properly handles concurrent requests
2. localStorage is available and reliable in target browsers
3. Network connectivity is generally stable (graceful degradation for offline scenarios)
4. Tutorial event data structure remains consistent
5. Users typically add 1-3 tutorials per session (not bulk operations)

### Out of Scope
- Multi-tab synchronization (identified as edge case, not in requirements)
- Offline-first architecture (current behavior acceptable)
- Real-time cart sharing between users
- Undo/redo functionality for cart operations
- Cart version conflict resolution

---

## Success Metrics

### Functional Success
- Zero instances of "second tutorial overwrites first" bug after fix
- 100% consistency between summary bar and cart display
- All edge cases handled gracefully with appropriate error messages

### Technical Success
- All integration tests pass for multi-tutorial workflows
- No race conditions detected in cart state management
- State synchronization completes within performance targets (FR-024, FR-025)

### User Experience Success
- Users can confidently add multiple tutorials without verification anxiety
- Clear feedback for all cart operations (loading states, success/error messages)
- State persists reliably across page refreshes
