## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer maintaining the product filtering system, I need the filter state management code to be organized into smaller, focused modules instead of one 459-line file, so that I can quickly understand, test, and modify filter logic without cognitive overload or risk of breaking unrelated functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Developer Navigates to Find Filter Logic
1. **Given** a developer needs to modify subject filter behavior
2. **When** they look for the relevant code
3. **Then** they should find it in a clearly named, focused module under 200 lines rather than scrolling through a 459-line file

#### Scenario 2: Developer Adds New Filter Type
1. **Given** a developer needs to add a new filter category
2. **When** they follow the established module pattern
3. **Then** they should be able to add the filter logic to the appropriate module without touching unrelated code

#### Scenario 3: Developer Runs Tests for Specific Filter Type
1. **Given** a developer modifies base filter logic
2. **When** they run tests for that module
3. **Then** tests should execute faster than loading the entire 459-line slice and only test relevant functionality

#### Scenario 4: Existing Components Import Filters
1. **Given** components across the application import filter actions and selectors
2. **When** the refactoring is complete
3. **Then** all existing imports continue to work without any code changes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a component imports actions from the old monolithic structure? (Must continue to work identically)
- How does the system handle simultaneous imports from different modules? (Should be seamless via re-exports)
- What if a developer needs to understand the full filter state? (Main slice provides complete overview)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Module Organization**
- **FR-001**: System MUST separate core filter actions (toggle, set, remove, clear for subjects, categories, product_types, products, modes_of_delivery) into a dedicated base filters module
- **FR-002**: System MUST separate navigation-specific filter actions (navSelectProduct, navSelectProductGroup, navSelectSubject) and navbar state into a dedicated navigation filters module
- **FR-003**: System MUST separate all filter selectors into a dedicated selectors module
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain a main filters slice that combines all modules and exports a unified public API

**Code Size and Clarity**
- **FR-005**: Each individual module MUST be under 200 lines
- **FR-006**: Main filters slice MUST be reduced from 459 lines to approximately 100-150 lines
- **FR-007**: Each module MUST have a single, clear responsibility documented in comments

**Backward Compatibility**
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain identical export structure so existing imports continue to work without modification
- **FR-009**: System MUST re-export all actions from the main slice so components can import them exactly as before
- **FR-010**: System MUST re-export all selectors from the main slice so components can import them exactly as before

**Testing and Quality**
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide independent test files for each new module (base filters, navigation filters, selectors)
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure all existing tests continue to pass after refactoring
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow testing individual modules independently without loading the entire slice

**Performance**
- **FR-014**: System MUST execute filter actions in the same time as before refactoring
- **FR-015**: System MUST execute selectors with identical performance to before refactoring
- **FR-016**: System MUST maintain or reduce bundle size (benefiting from tree-shaking)

**Documentation**
- **FR-017**: System MUST include comments explaining the module organization and separation of concerns
- **FR-018**: System MUST document why the split was performed (addressing God Object code smell)
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide guidance for developers adding new filters in the future

### Key Entities

**Code Modules** (representing logical separation of filter state management):

- **Base Filters Module**: Contains core filter state (subjects, categories, product_types, products, modes_of_delivery, searchQuery, pagination) and standard filter actions (toggle, set, remove, clear) that apply to the main product filtering functionality

- **Navigation Filters Module**: Contains navbar-specific filter state (tutorial_format, distance_learning, tutorial) and navigation actions (navSelectProduct, navSelectProductGroup, navSelectSubject) that have special filter-clearing behaviors for navigation flows

- **Filter Selectors Module**: Contains all selectors for accessing filter state (selectFilters, selectSubjects, selectCategories, etc.) and derived selectors (selectHasActiveFilters, selectActiveFilterCount) that compute values from the base state

- **Main Filters Slice**: Combines all modules into a unified Redux slice, maintains the public API by re-exporting all actions and selectors, and coordinates filter state management across the application

## Notes

### Context from Story 1.14
This specification is derived from Story 1.14 in the Product Filtering State Management Refactoring epic (Phase 3 - Architecture Improvements, Priority 2). The story addresses a God Object code smell where filtersSlice.js has grown to 459 lines with too many responsibilities.

### Dependencies
- Stories 1.1-1.13 must be complete (filter system must be stable)
- Estimated effort: 1-2 days
- Epic: Product Filtering State Management Refactoring

### Success Metrics
- Line count reduction: 459 lines ‚Üí ~100-150 lines (main slice)
- Module size: All modules < 200 lines
- Test coverage: Maintained at current levels (96/96 tests passing)
- Zero breaking changes: All existing component imports work unchanged
- Performance: No degradation (< 0.1ms URL sync maintained)

### Technical Context (for planning phase)
The refactoring will use Redux Toolkit slice composition patterns and ES6 module imports/exports to achieve the modular design while maintaining the facade pattern where the main slice exports a combined interface. The detailed technical implementation is documented in the story file at docs/stories/story-1.14-extract-long-methods-filtersslice.md.
