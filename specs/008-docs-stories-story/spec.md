## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story (Story 1.15 - Performance Monitoring)

**As a developer**, I need to measure the performance of filter operations so that I can identify bottlenecks and optimize slow operations without impacting production users.

**Developer Workflow**:
1. Developer enables performance monitoring in development mode
2. Developer performs filter operations (set subjects, navigate, search)
3. System automatically records timing metrics for all filter-related operations
4. Developer views performance metrics in browser console and Redux DevTools
5. Developer identifies operations exceeding performance budgets
6. Developer optimizes slow operations and re-measures
7. Performance monitoring code is automatically removed from production builds

### Primary User Story (Story 1.16 - Integration Testing)

**As a QA engineer**, I need comprehensive integration tests that verify filter components work together correctly so that I can catch integration bugs before they reach production.

**Developer/QA Workflow**:
1. Developer/QA engineer runs full integration test suite
2. Tests verify Redux middleware interactions (urlSync, RTK Query)
3. Tests verify FilterRegistry and FilterValidator integration
4. Tests verify component collaboration (FilterPanel → Redux → ProductList)
5. Tests verify persistence and backward compatibility
6. Tests complete in <30 seconds with 90%+ coverage
7. Tests use mocked API responses for deterministic results

### Acceptance Scenarios (Story 1.15)

1. **Given** performance monitoring is enabled in development, **When** a filter operation is dispatched, **Then** timing metrics are recorded and logged
2. **Given** an operation exceeds its performance budget, **When** the operation completes, **Then** a warning is logged to the console
3. **Given** production mode is enabled, **When** the application is built, **Then** all performance monitoring code is tree-shaken and removed
4. **Given** Redux DevTools is open, **When** filter operations are performed, **Then** timing metrics are visible in custom DevTools panels
5. **Given** multiple filter operations occur, **When** viewing metrics, **Then** historical trends and averages are available

### Acceptance Scenarios (Story 1.16)

1. **Given** a filter change is dispatched, **When** the integration test runs, **Then** the URL is verified to update correctly
2. **Given** a component renders, **When** the integration test provides mock store data, **Then** the component displays the correct filter state
3. **Given** the API is called, **When** the integration test intercepts the request, **Then** MSW returns the mock response without network calls
4. **Given** FilterValidator runs, **When** invalid filter combinations are tested, **Then** validation errors are correctly returned
5. **Given** backward compatibility tests run, **When** legacy filter operations are performed, **Then** all existing imports and actions work unchanged

### Edge Cases

**Performance Monitoring**:
- What happens when performance.mark() is not supported by the browser?
- How does system handle recursive performance tracking (monitoring the monitor)?
- What happens when performance budget violations occur in production? (Should never happen - monitoring disabled)
- How are performance metrics aggregated across multiple filter operations?

**Integration Testing**:
- What happens when MSW fails to intercept an API call?
- How does system handle tests that exceed the 30-second timeout?
- What happens when coverage falls below 90%?
- How are flaky tests identified and handled?
- What happens when backward compatibility tests fail after refactoring?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements (Story 1.15 - Performance Monitoring)

**Performance Tracking**:
- **FR-001**: System MUST track timing metrics for all filter Redux actions
- **FR-002**: System MUST track timing metrics for URL synchronization operations
- **FR-003**: System MUST track timing metrics for FilterValidator operations
- **FR-004**: System MUST track timing metrics for FilterRegistry operations
- **FR-005**: System MUST track timing metrics for API calls via RTK Query

**Performance Budgets**:
- **FR-006**: System MUST enforce a 16ms performance budget for Redux operations (60 FPS threshold)
- **FR-007**: System MUST enforce a 5ms performance budget for URL sync operations
- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce a 1000ms performance budget for API calls
- **FR-009**: System MUST enforce a 10ms performance budget for FilterValidator operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST enforce a 1ms performance budget for FilterRegistry operations
- **FR-011**: System MUST log warnings when operations exceed their performance budgets

**Development vs Production**:
- **FR-012**: System MUST enable performance monitoring only in development mode
- **FR-013**: System MUST remove all performance monitoring code from production builds via tree-shaking
- **FR-014**: System MUST have zero runtime overhead in production [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should basic monitoring (low overhead) be enabled in production for real-world metrics?]

**Reporting & Visualization**:
- **FR-015**: System MUST log performance metrics to browser console in development mode
- **FR-016**: System MUST integrate performance metrics with Redux DevTools
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide historical performance trends and averages
- **FR-018**: System MUST support configurable monitoring levels (minimal, standard, verbose) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are performance thresholds validated with user testing data or are they theoretical targets?]

### Functional Requirements (Story 1.16 - Integration Testing)

**Test Infrastructure**:
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide test utilities for rendering components with Redux store and routing
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide utilities for creating mock Redux stores with pre-configured state
- **FR-021**: System MUST provide utilities for mocking RTK Query API endpoints
- **FR-022**: System MUST use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking in integration tests

**Test Coverage**:
- **FR-023**: System MUST achieve 90%+ code coverage for integration tests [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is 90% coverage mandatory or aspirational?]
- **FR-024**: System MUST complete full integration test suite in <30 seconds
- **FR-025**: System MUST test Redux middleware integration (urlSync, RTK Query)
- **FR-026**: System MUST test FilterRegistry and FilterValidator integration
- **FR-027**: System MUST test component collaboration (FilterPanel, ActiveFilters, ProductList)
- **FR-028**: System MUST test backward compatibility with Story 1.14 refactoring [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should tests use real API in CI or always use mocks?]

### Key Entities *(performance monitoring & testing infrastructure)*

**Story 1.15 Entities**:
- **PerformanceTracker**: Utility class that wraps Browser Performance API (performance.mark, performance.measure) to record timing metrics for filter operations
- **Performance Budget**: Configuration object defining maximum allowed execution times for different operation types (Redux: 16ms, URL sync: 5ms, API: 1000ms, validation: 10ms, registry: 1ms)
- **Performance Metric**: Recorded timing data including operation name, duration, timestamp, budget status (within/exceeded)
- **Monitoring Level**: Configuration setting controlling verbosity of performance logging (minimal, standard, verbose)

**Story 1.16 Entities**:
- **Test Utility (renderWithProviders)**: Helper function that renders React components with Redux store, Router, and other providers configured
- **Test Utility (createMockStore)**: Factory function that creates Redux store instances with pre-configured filter state for testing
- **Test Utility (mockProductsApi)**: Helper function that configures MSW handlers for product API endpoints with mock response data
- **MSW Handler**: Mock Service Worker request handlers that intercept API calls and return deterministic mock responses
- **Integration Test Suite**: Collection of test files covering middleware integration, component collaboration, and backward compatibility
