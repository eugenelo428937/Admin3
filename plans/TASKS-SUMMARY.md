## Critical Gates

### Story 1.10
- **GATE 1**: Tests (T004-T011) must ALL FAIL before implementation (T012-T014)
- **GATE 2**: Tests must ALL PASS before integration (T015-T016)

### Story 1.11
- **GATE 1**: Tests (T003-T006) must ALL FAIL before implementation (T007-T008)
- **GATE 2**: Tests must ALL PASS before FilterPanel migration (T009)
- **GATE 3**: FilterPanel visual verification (T011) must PASS before ActiveFilters (T012)
- **GATE 4**: ActiveFilters visual verification (T014) must PASS before final verification

### Story 1.12
- **GATE 1**: Tests (T003-T007) must ALL FAIL before implementation (T008)
- **GATE 2**: Tests must ALL PASS before Redux integration (T009)
- **GATE 3**: Redux tests (T011) must PASS before UI integration (T012)
- **GATE 4**: UI tests (T013) must PASS before API prevention (T014)
- **GATE 5**: API tests (T015) must PASS before integration tests (T016-T017)

### Story 1.13
- **GATE 1**: Pre-removal verification (T001-T003) must ALL PASS before removal (T004-T007)
- **GATE 2**: Post-removal verification (T008-T009) must PASS before marking complete

## Execution Order Recommendation

### Sequential Execution (if doing one at a time)
1. **Story 1.10** (Centralized URL Parameter Utility) - Foundation
2. **Story 1.11** (Filter Registry Pattern) - Extensibility
3. **Story 1.12** (Filter Validation Logic) - User Experience
4. **Story 1.13** (Remove Cookie Persistence) - Cleanup

**Rationale**: Story 1.10 creates the utility, Story 1.11 can optionally integrate with it (T015), Stories 1.12-1.13 are independent but build on the foundation.

### Parallel Execution (if doing multiple stories concurrently)
- **Group A (Parallel)**: Story 1.10 + Story 1.12 (no dependencies)
- **Group B (After 1.10)**: Story 1.11 (optional dependency on 1.10 via T015)
- **Group C (After all)**: Story 1.13 (cleanup task)

## Task Template Compliance

All task files follow the `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` structure:

✅ **Format**: `[ID] [P?] Description` with exact file paths
✅ **Phases**: Setup → Tests → Implementation → Integration → Polish
✅ **TDD**: Tests before implementation with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
✅ **Parallel Marking**: [P] for independent tasks (different files)
✅ **Dependencies**: Clear dependency graphs and execution order
✅ **Parallel Examples**: Concrete Task agent command examples
✅ **Validation Checklists**: Gate checks before completion

## Next Steps

1. **Review task files**: Verify all tasks are clear and executable
2. **Execute /tasks command**: Already completed for all 4 stories
3. **Begin implementation**: Start with Story 1.10 following TDD approach
4. **Track progress**: Use TodoWrite for each story's task list
5. **Verify gates**: Ensure all GATE conditions pass before proceeding

## Notes

- All tasks include exact file paths for immediate execution
- TDD approach enforced with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR phases
- Visual verification gates prevent regression in UI-changing tasks
- Performance requirements specified (< 1ms for 1.10, < 5ms for 1.12)
- Rollback plans included for removal/migration tasks
- Comprehensive test coverage targets (≥90-95%)
- Manual testing scenarios documented for UX validation
