## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Add Product with Different Price Types
- [ ] Add same product with standard price
- [ ] Add same product with retaker price
- [ ] Add same product with additional copy price
- [ ] Verify separate cart items are created

### 2. Cart Panel Display
- [ ] Verify price type badges are shown for non-standard prices
- [ ] Verify actual prices are displayed
- [ ] Verify standard price items don't show badges

### 3. Checkout Process
- [ ] Verify price information is shown during checkout
- [ ] Complete checkout and verify order is created with price information
- [ ] Check admin interface for order details

### 4. Order History
- [ ] View order history and verify price type information is displayed
- [ ] Verify actual prices are shown for historical orders

## Configuration Files
